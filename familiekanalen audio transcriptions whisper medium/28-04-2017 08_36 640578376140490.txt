 
Let the children, let the children, let the children be set free
Let the children, let the children, let the children come to me
Let the children, let the children let the children be set free
Let the children, let the children let the children come to
me
To their father, to their mother, to their home, their family
Let the children, let the children, let the children be set free
How did
this start?
It started with Ronny getting three of his biological children back from the Swedish childbirth Did he live in Sweden at one point?
Since the Swedish childbirth was over?
Five years, five and a half years
So they got you back after a while over there?
Yes Then they lived with you, three children
Then they came to Neustad, we had involved the childbirth service in Neustad in the picture that comes back to you
There they had an investigation of us as a family And wrote a report back to the Swedish childbirth They had nothing to report about us
as care staff or personliness
There
were many moments, but nothing to report And the report from the Swedish childbirth?
It was from a friend in Neustad, who had a lot of information about us
Then they found nothing?
Then he got his grandmother back First the youngest came And a month
later the middle and oldest girl came
How old was
Spenro?
The youngest was about six years old And eight and nine Eight, yes
Then we quickly noticed that this was a child with very big special needs
It was clear that this was a child who had
no growth conditions The youngest used, among other things, the blanket Had exposed the We started to do a collaboration to help these children We had a child who was mid-aged Then we had a girl who was quite newborn when she came In the first childbirth, the left and right were almost ready to help us It was very difficult to get helpers in place Did you just start to look or did you get help?
After each meeting, the children were examined at the PPP BUP after each year
There was a lot of conflict between BUP and the child welfare service BUP said that the child welfare service did not do the right thing for us as a family In relation to that need The PPP concluded that this was a child who had two to three years after development
The BUP expert said that most of the child welfare service did not do the right thing BUP also has a better competence than the child welfare service
It is a little higher than the child welfare service The child welfare service argued that this was a phase of choice
It was his strong desire to get these children back
He had chosen it himself
It was our
problem to get this to work That was what we concluded The child welfare service
focused on this from the perspective of the adults Yes, you got your children back
That is your problem
The focus was not on the children
I think that if you start talking, the children come first
It is the perspective of the children to take When the children lived in Sweden
, they were placed in different post offices They were moved several times to different post offices We were not taken care of at all I noticed that when we visited them once a month When you were four years old How did you experience and see the children?
We saw that they were very happy when we came But we saw that they did not have a good time
They did not
want to stay at home and move back to us They were very
hysterical when we were leaving We also
noticed that
they had
poor language
Poor hygiene, very
poor clothes We often had myosin clothes and equipment for them
It was also reported that when they received birthday gifts Christmas presents, this was taken away from these foster families in Sweden
They were not allowed to keep it Because they had to keep it Was it taken away or was it given to others?
It was given to others and to the children
Biological children
I saw that the Finnish report on the children's home Where the minister was in public office
It was reported that foster
children who had received Christmas presents
Were taken
away and
given to the biological children
They got something cheap For example, they got a bicycle But the children received biological data And the foster children got a used bicycle Yes, it was a bit of a It was reported that these three children felt very unfair treatment
In relation to our children who
lived there It was a bit of a jealousy We worked a lot with this
Every year we got some care fees It was very allowed because the children
were taken
away
And
then we got it back
It was very unstable for the children And they were moved back But after a while it turned out that
Things got better and better They calmed down and started to get back to safety But then in the autumn of 2013 We noticed that her oldest daughter Was very aggressive
She spoke very harshly We wondered what it was What it was that she suddenly
got to Change It was in the 13th of December Yes, 12th of December It was 13th of December Then we went to the 6th of December in 2013
I was travelling to work tomorrow At my work in Barnage It had been about an hour When the police called me Before they released the national photo
I had half an hour to get to Arhøi If I didn't get there in half an hour
They had to come and get me
Did you plant a bomb in Pødde?
No, to put it like that
They had delivered two of our youngest daughters To Barnage We were pregnant We had
a son in February 2014
It was not that scary
Usually when you go to
Arhøi They get you in a letter And then they tell you when you can come But not in half an hour
It was a real comfort to say it like that
I was very scared
I didn't understand what it was It was not told
I had to travel from work
It was a short way, about five
minutes It was not much
I got to the police station I still didn't know anything
I was just placed in a room
I was informed that a patrolman was sent to the police station To my husband Ronny With two police officers
I asked what they were doing
I was told that these three children
Were taken
by the child welfare service And that they were the Sister in law of the school
Where they were born?
In Næustål We were suspected of serious violence against these children
I was shocked
I was totally surprised
I was a little worried about what happened to him What happened to the other children Who were in the school
It went through a thousand thoughts
It was all about... What did you know?
What kind of violence?
In a very small degree
It was about spasch and lugging
That was mostly what it was about
Did the children tell you about the sister in law?
After a while we were told that The elderly girl had been in a room with her sister in law And told about the violence in the home
I saw on the first hearing
I was completely convinced that The children had been planted
They couldn't
have been
able to
speak the language Or could have been
able to
speak the language
It was a little
bit of a proof
It was revealed that the children were treated at the school
The first time she loved the daughter
She was treated as a bully The youngest man had
also started telling about the bully Even the bully had written a report About how close and close they were It was never taken into consideration in the countryside
Or in the district
There were no places We were then, after a quarter, exposed to a serious accusation By the child welfare agency in Neustad We were on a pregnancy control When he was born Here at the hospital Where the child welfare agency in Neustad had parked our car At the parking lot And went directly to the police And registered us for kidnapping
Of
his youngest son
In what way
did you kidnap
him?
He was in the child welfare agency
He had a lot of ear, nose and throat problems We thought he was in control We knew something about it
It also turned out that the police had been very strict with the child welfare agency
Two days later the police came to the door With contact and visitation The child welfare agency and the police were standing there And denied that it wasn't because of that incident Because we documented that it was my first child And that we had been
there
So you were in control of the car And the child was not born And then the child welfare agency escalated in Neustad
By thinking that you were going to kidnap your youngest son Who was going to be in control of the car
There wasn't
much control at the time Everyone was going to control the car Yes, it was a disease And then the child welfare agency escalated
Wasn't it called
Lohen?
Yes, it was
Monika Lohen And then it was her and Nuda Nythøy
So they escalated the situation without knowing anything concrete
They think that their car is there
So they are going to kidnap someone who was going to control They don't check with them if they were going to control
That this is
purely accidental
They just escalated the situation and made a drama
They called the police And they made a drama And made a real drama
It was the first case of the crime
So they were afraid that we were going to kidnap the child And that
they would find the right person And the right person
didn't take any action
They just stood there and tried to kidnap the child And the child welfare agency never told him or her
They just stood there and tried to kidnap the child
It was
never talked about
going back and telling him that we had never been there to kidnap him And today we live in the belief that we were there to kidnap him
It is a bit like a drama course And you are wrong because the child welfare agency has a law They are going to work for a return If the parent is not able to take care of the child The child welfare agency will work for the parent to be able to take care of the child And to run with such a drama
I feel that the employer is a good dialogue It is not easy to keep a dialogue with people who are going to make a drama for nothing After a while more and more complaints came from the child welfare agency The child welfare agency blamed the child for opening up after they were placed How long had they lived with you after you came from Sweden?
It was from 2011 to December 6th, 2013
Did anyone else give an explanation for the child being concerned about the child before the child suddenly died?
It turned out that one Norwegian had a relationship with the child welfare
agency
So they had him to write some false
statements
Did he see it daily?
No, not at all So he had no social relationship with the child?
He could not observe the daily life of the child?
He was not very well-behaved?
No, he drove past the house and from the field
So he was the plant of the child welfare agency as a
provider
So that the child welfare agency could find something We also had good contact with a neighbour family The oldest daughter was the best friend The first time she told about violence, she was also the first to tell about violence in her home
Both of these friends were exposed to violence in both of their families Biological mother had contact with the child on social media and on the phone But here she took the phone And if the child was in the house?
The child welfare agency in Naustad was aware that this was a conflict of parents Because biological mother did not want the father to have these children
It was a child distribution case where she expressed that it was not good that the father saw
It started a week after he had got the children back
Then she started the process Was the daughter exposed to violence?
No, she was trying to get back all three children
It was a case in Fjordland with Ingrid I won that case that time We also understood that the police had
a good relationship with the child welfare agency Was it the police in the house or the family in Naustad?
It was the family
It is a small relationship A room here will have contacts on personal plans very quickly
Then it disappears professionally We experienced that very strongly The police took everything from the child welfare agency
The police also made contact with the child welfare agency
To remove this contact and ban on visits
It was a very close relationship
They worked for the child welfare agency Sissle Kleivand, who was responsible for the punishment
She said directly in the law in Bergen that she had contact with the foster parents In the time this was going on
It was probably to give an impression that she had a lot of insight But she probably did not see the daily care
She probably did not work on it
It is not her
job The police and lawyers mix well
It was a great job
This happened in 2013 The Law Enforcement was in the summer of 2016 It was a long process to document that these violent acts had not happened My mother started to mix this
She had
a child with an ox She had had a hip operation six times She sat in a wheelchair and walked on the porch
She has not had a child in the last 15-20 years
They construct a case instead of a conflict
They construct something that looks good to win The lawyers were very good
They were very good
He was the next mayor
He was in the literature house in Bergen He was reading the papers and he said that he was involved in this
He said that he should win That was his focus We reacted very strongly to the court They closed the stories to Beksund with their tongue
They never asked questions
They were denied by the witnesses You were not allowed to bring witnesses in?
No There were eight witnesses who were denied You get the impression that the court is in a state of emergency They don't want to hear arguments
They don't write it down so that it can be used
later You shouldn't be
able to do much just to understand that
To bring
witnesses is human rights You were not allowed to do that
It was a constructed case The law has described it in its court
Here the children have a list of what
they should say in court The children have not been told that this is a story of discovery
They made a clear statement that the children had said what was constructed
They had a jury hearing
The boy had two jury
hearings The first jury hearing was not very violent
The next jury hearing was one or two months
later Suddenly the boy said that he was kicked down the stairs
He was done Suddenly he was very angry and said that
there was one more thing he should say You get the impression that he was instructed to bring this and that Was it the police who denied it?
They didn't know how to respond
They just
had to say it and that's it
The children's court says that
they haven't talked to the boy in the meantime But the papers show what they have done The parents and the children's court
They lie about what
they had done And the papers show that they had talked to him Yes, they had papers on everything
There is something called the fine for life for a victim But they don't use it when they hit themselves
It seems that the child protection law is exempted
from
Norwegian law Norwegian law is not valid for child protection law You often get the impression that they are a state in the state The police don't have one reason or have such a close bond with these
They don't
have any resistance at all That's a bit scary
There are 8-9 cases against
Norwegian children in the state Just because of this
There are cases from the high court
There is
no answer, but it is in the books The books don't have time to look at them That's the kind of thing that happens But of course this has had huge consequences for us as a family We have three children
So we have
taken over all areas So no one has anything to blame And of course
I had to leave
my
job
Ronny didn't get out of work
This has had serious economic consequences for us
So the child protection law conserved this
case
And that made our house
go on a prison break
And this also happened at the same time
So this case and the child protection law were punished
It
has been
a big burden
It is common for people to be exposed to public abuse And at several points We are going to take care of you, we are taking care of the house, the child, job away Yes, they really had to take care of themselves And only after we won the punishment case
It was a return case
for the three young people
They took the punishment case down And then it was released
It was released for the charges So it was a return case And then the municipality responded with the parent's money And then they denied the address again And denied the protection So then it was there At the same time, the municipality went through the total debt sales It was not about getting us back to work
Getting us back on our feet
So then the municipality got the rent And they had written the financial concerns
They got the money to buy the house for the half-partner tax 400 000
That is pure nonsense
There is a district attorney in Naustad He is the boss for all employees And
I have seen him on TV
Where he tries to calm down But it is pretty
Poor He has been involved before the fire here
He was involved because they could stop the fire And not only that But when they had passed the fire The neighbor went and robbed our house Before they could take out the money And he threw it away We didn't get it And he threw it away
It helped the young people we had passed
This is a bit strange Or later That you call the police We have registered it to the police And we have a police license
But they prioritize him instead of us Because they think we have come with a violent threat against him But it is a bit...
The goal is to understand what the municipality did against you
They took out the house
Instead of letting you come in And pay Was it a public decision?
It was a big public decision Instead of giving the family some time
They destroyed the whole family The children should have been on the ground
To help the parents in the process
To have the care But they are doing it against you Yes, and it was clearly too defensive
For the children's protection in Neustad That we were thrown out And things to the children Everything was destroyed They had produced the case and taken the sacks From the children But they also had
to take everything they had
It is...
It is a Neustad municipality With the council and the child care department And there are a lot of cases in Neustad That happen We all know the Bonarjo case
Where Krask on the bak Was caught with five children being snatched In the same way And they went on a total loss And in the end they moved back to Romania Traumatized the whole family
On direct false charges And there is a lot of the same you tell About the same child care in Neustad They construct something
To calm the conflict And find out in a way They get a neighbour to spy And produce And a healthy sister
Who has openly gone out
On her full power As a healthy sister And when they took the sacks The sacks disappeared
Then they should have
taken the drawings Now we have to
Put an end to the child's guilt Get you on your feet again Instead it will be a slap hunt At least not on planes We take their house We always start with good help now And
I am also very pleased
With the question That a healthy sister
Can travel to a school
Take in children And sit there alone with children And talk without That it becomes a question
So much more critical It's like you read about
Maybe in North Korea Where the state owns everything But it is not Norway The healthy sister
has obviously
The most rights
Children have Children should
Even in relation to the children
Children have demands on a number of people We lived in Nævstals
For two to eight years
After they took the three children
After they took the three children
It has not been the only meeting With the Nævstals municipality
They have not done any research
In
order to do anything
Suddenly here At the end of 2015 The case was moved over To the municipality And maybe the Nævstals Were responsible
So the municipality did How old was the reason
Did you move or was it something like that No, then the responsibility Is so inherent Nævstals?
When you have seen
A family and then it was suddenly
Inhabitable
I call that throwing responsibility From, so do not take responsibility Okay, now take the case Away in Førde And then we wash our hands Now we have destroyed what we can
Now I
got the first connection With my eldest daughter here in Førde
It was really good connection
So then
I take
It was possible to fix the length Yes And then it took four or five days
The Nævstals municipality Had a connection with her
Then they took it back, moved it back And then the Nævstals came back It's just the head And then
Then
I just have to tell them that they have taken The responsibility of the parents, so they have nothing With the young people, so there will be no Co-operative or anything What do the children say, have you got any signals No, not at all They go back to the village No, I mean, it's so good
It was that the children we have Here and she was older
They were very happy
They were very happy And they saw very much
To be able to get
back in touch And to be in the team again But now the Nævstals The child care service is destroyed Yes Did they give any reasons for it?
No They just called To the parents and said, we take the case back To us And then they make it even more difficult for them And not least for the children Yes The children are prevented from getting in touch with the father And other children in the family And extended family, of course Yes Everything is sabotaged from the Nævstals Yes
So now it's 2017
They should soon take the drawing
Now they have figured it out With the Bonarjus case And they gave
I mean, they reported The parents, I don't know if the case is finished Because the parents didn't come to the punishment For the violence But they reported the parents To the police for violence And still they gave
Five children back to the same parents And then they
Run after Against these Who just for good reason
Moved from the country Yes, absolutely And they experience the same Violence in the law And then the child welfare chief In the Nævstals And the warden And the director They are held
responsible
They continue to be a witch Because
I mean From the outside
I would assume That if they were to win
They would
be In a very bad situation If the children
Would come or show
That this works Get in touch with you Show that there is no There is no conflict between parents and children
Then there is a certain Child welfare chief in the ward Who reported me But she is responsible She is personally responsible
For this In the Nævstals So that is And here you have A child welfare officer Who tries to build up
That relationship
He tries to take some responsibility For what he understands And then the Nævstals Take the municipality and burn
There regularly
So with one time The child welfare chief in Nævstals Finds out that the child and the father have contact
Then they take the case back And cut off all contact
They just have to
They got a report from the ward That they had
a problem No, she was home So that went well
Then they got a problem
In the Nævstals and then
They quickly took the case back There are some strange
things In this building
I think that
They are not sitting to see What is the best for the child And what is not They are not helping the family Or building relationships
Or Driving with the help of the roof They just drive To crush the family What they absolutely can And
I think also
As politicians
As a citizen
They have to
take Some responsibility They can
not let such Unprofessional people
It seems that it has become
Very personal They should not get it While the law Attacks this child welfare chief In there and build up Relationships
So that when
They then on paper See that this can go
Then the children are back But here they do it the opposite They build down every time
They start opening
a bridge And then they start
building
Right away
So it is in a way
They feel that they have Sought back to you The only goal
You have had
It is in a way to crush us Crush us so mentally That we in a way Should not be able to
Take power enough to Some children live In the part now We have him
Instead of three years And she and the girl at six years And then there are three Who live outside Your child, who lives outside
He loves them My daughter, but he is soon 18 years old So he is past But the children
Say they Meet Without coming here I do not know if We know Three different
Go live in
Førske In Førte In Anrikke, she is on the save address
I have saved the address
I do not know where they live No, but it is heard
So The dynamics In what is told
It is what you often Connect with the child welfare chief In other cases And other cases From Nælstedt It is the same
Family-fiendish
behavior And I would like to
Put it in a professional Basis To prevent The daughter in contact With it Because they do not have any more
Strapgear to run on Then it becomes personal Home from the child welfare chief
Maybe well helped
By a shelter behind Which is called Vegsund
I think
I see the footprint Of his walk around
He does not just work in this municipality He is famous From other municipalities He is standing in Strynå In Førte And he was Very clear About it In that case When they were going to take him For the long term
Then Vegsund said directly
That
he had no trust
He had no understanding Before the long term
So he was not interested
In dealing with it That was Vegsund's Personal opinion And that is probably the reason
For him
I have gotten
back
From
other lawyers who also know him But who do not want him to look like That he is a type
That first
I win And then Which league you go over That is completely uninterested And that is seen in The Norge case, he was there
He has been up in Strynå And then he went out And more personal Opfattning of him As a municipal lawyer It is that he has a game
With these children's rights
Chiefs About that
Once
they see that here it can be A case, here it can be
Then he should be contacted And he demands an acute care Because then he sees that It is not about him on the court Then it becomes a public case
Then it becomes a case for Ingeret And here is the money That is being managed Because it is very rare You hear things about
him He has been a Dignomit- or child care manager In Nørrsta Where they build up Now Build relationships
Get to Communication What the law says Yes, yes That they should actually do Yes But we have got Such a basic The requirements In the first step Yes So It is nice out there But The municipal services
Up here
They can perhaps
ask A serious question about
If the child care
manager in Nørrsta Is competent for this job
If he follows the law Or if it is personal Then it is connected with The municipal government And the economic Participation In having such a case It is not much to do
If the child comes home
Because then it is not A case anymore
There is no conflict
That people can do And it is a big apparatus
That makes money That the foster industry Should have What shall we say Adoption of Child care manager As we call it So, ok Now you have got a Little feeling Of how the Nåkel family Connected to
Nørrsta child care manager Experience Municipal authorities And those who work there
So, I say thank you We will be back With more from
Nørrsta But this time We will look at the nice weather In the Føude, the sun is shining
It is white on the mountains
The wind is still on the sea Maybe we should go fishing there Isn't salmon coming out of the islands here?
There is salmon, we have been fishing
I have seen some who fish Ok, it is nice in
Føude But the municipal
authorities Maybe can do something about it Thank you for us
This is what it looks like in Føude today
It looks
Nice weather White on the top Still a bit of fun The Nørrsta child care manager Experience Municipal authorities And those who work there
So, I say thank you We will be back With more from
Nørrsta But this time We will look at the nice weather In the Føude, the sun is shining
It is white on the mountains
The wind is still on the sea Maybe we should go fishing there Isn't salmon coming out of the islands there?
Doesn't look good
Where did all 10 family members go?
Where is the fish DOWN?
Then let us knowcker's We are now behind

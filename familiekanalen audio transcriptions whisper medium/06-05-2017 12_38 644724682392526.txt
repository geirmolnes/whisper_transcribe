 
Let the children be set free!
To their father, to their mother, to their home, their family
Let the children, let the children, let the children be set free Welcome to a new show here in the Family
Channel My name is
Rune Fardal And today
I am visiting the host, Per-Einhard Guthus, here in Tønsberg And he is probably known to most of you who have followed the special fight against child care and what they are doing here in Tønsberg And the last days they have profiled as very victims, these child care bosses and employees in child care down here So, we will discuss a little and then we will talk a little about this program So, Per, what did you start with?
How did you get into this with child care?
How did you get an insight into this?
I have been very fond of a safe child care system, after the protection of children
I have been involved for several years through an association, Two Parents, which fought for child rights and made good contact with both parents after a joint strike
So
I have been very involved with child care and
I never thought
I would be one who would benefit from this
In short, I have worked a lot with a vaccine that
I myself got in the military And
I have worked a lot with evidence, and therefore
I was one of the skeptics around the Pandemrix vaccine in 2009 Which I had documented that you would get an eclipsed before you started this vaccine project And there was a doctor who disagreed with me and he abused the child care system to get me into trouble And I was one of the people who tried to deliver the documentation that
I had And I understand that people were critical that time, you got one thing in the media and I was on the other And
I thought that this was very easy to say to the children that they can read the documentation themselves But that was not the case, they started following the difficulties of me and went to school And the teachers at school knew that
I was active in this area, so they asked if it was him who was in the focus And the children answered that it was not, there is something behind it, but we have not promised to say anything about it And then
I suddenly noticed that teachers and other parents, because this spreads quite quickly Either you are violent in my case, or you are a pedophile Because the child care system is so serious that you think that there must be something scary about it And then it was just that there was a opponent who had put in some warning
I managed to follow him and
I got a message The children became angry and started a new case three days after
I had to stop the case And passed on the same content as before, and then had to stop again
So that was my experience You got the story that this was critical to these paumio vaccines, you got it right
I paid a few hundred million in compensation to those who got narcolepsy
It's sad that you can not miss the child care in such a situation And I was
actually done with child care
then
It was out of my
life
Then I was out in the city one evening and was going home a little early I drove to the car, but
I was hungry so
I went into a pizza restaurant And went to the store where they sold pizza And there
I was once before, and
I was very impressed by the guy who was behind And had control of the hundred pieces
he ate And delivered pizza and took some money and managed the whole shop of those who made the food
So I was so fascinated by him, but then there was one day
I came in there
It was empty in the place and everyone looked very nefarious
There was
a strange atmosphere
I knew about And then
I asked where the boss was, because
I used to call him boss And
he stepped on my shoulders and then he peeked into the back room And there
I went in and saw that he was lying under a bench and crying
And I asked what had happened, what has happened
He was most concerned about the food
I had made, but I asked what was wrong with you And then he hung up on me and said that please
help me, the babysitter took my child
I don't understand why, the wife just cried and cried Were they from Turkey?
No, they were from Kurdistan And they had come as refugees to Norway, they had three children who were very close And this father had a contract with the place he worked He had
to make pizza during the day and sell it
at night And the wife was alone with the children, she was tired And then there was this small thing he found on something else
They jumped out of that little window and there was a basement there And then they ran to the main street in the middle of the city And smiled at the world as the children do when they run away Exciting, but right next to it there lived a woman And she saw these small things and sent a concern report And she profited from this with the babysitter And the babysitter contacted them and sent letters, but these were Norwegian anaphobets And didn't understand the difference between advertising and letters, so they didn't meet And then
they tried again and after a while
they started to talk about violence That the father had beaten the mother, so they talked about it But he asked for help to read and understand what was written And then I said, do you know how difficult it is to be Norwegian in this system?
And then
I started reading and started to see how wrong
this was It's very strange when the children approach a family That they don't know Berkish-Norwegian That they don't ask for an interpretation, that they are a little more professional That they show
willingness to solve a case Instead of giving them documents that they don't understand Everything was in Norwegian And this was Kurdish that maybe didn't speak Norwegian at all And they think they should communicate
Here comes the human rights
And they haven't worked in this case at all And when I started reading this, the father didn't trust the babysitter Because he said they were just lying and lying
So at the first meeting he asked me to come And
I felt the babysitter a little bit from before
So I was on our own safety
I took on the recording and the hidden microphone
didn't come out
It was mostly to be sure of what
I said And
not to abuse the recording in that way But when we came to this, I just met
the interpreter And she met me and took me in her hands And said, please help this family
, the babysitter is lying and lying And they really need help, the interpreter said that at the first meeting And I thought, what in the world is this?
And then
I sat down to meet with this And then the case negotiator starts And he talked about it and then he said
He doesn't speak Norwegian and they are taking the kids back That was decided, we could help them with the baby sorrow But the parents also said that at the first meeting
They had another child and
they were at home And then they got a message to forget the three kids And concentrate on the new one And then she said a sentence that
I think is
awful
Because they also said afterwards
That they are siblings in blood, they are siblings in names
They share genes, but otherwise they have no other relationship with each other And I was shocked, I have this on record And then there was a meeting later And I was told that
I would be part of this meeting And it was critical that
I was there But it was okay, and they should have a meeting right before the meeting But that was never stopped
So
I had to tell the family about
Norwegian relations
Not to say we love you, we miss you Because we have a tendency to take ourselves back many times in this culture So don't say it more than three times that we love you And I took it with me and drove the two miles to where
I was supposed to be And
then
I got a message that you are not allowed to come here And if you come, we stop the meeting And
I chose to pull myself back, but
I told the aunt who was there
Film as much
as possible And I'm
very happy about that today Because there were three children who came running and threw themselves in the arms of their parents And called them
mom and dad And then you see the report that there is no answer between what is written in the report and the video we have And
I think that is very special That you can not trust that those who are in the place that is responsible for it, describe the current situation
They describe what they have received from the children's
society That should be the story
So they know that this self-reporting system they are doing Yes, and it is a one-sided focus on the negative
That there was a high volume, that there was little structure, that there was little organization And of course if you have not seen each other in a long time, there will be a clear sense of joy But consequently
a negative angle And
I have referred to this video many times
I have delivered 11 copies to the children's service Because they have said, oh,
I have not seen that We have had several changes of child welfare leaders And they have said, yes, I will see them on Christmas And then, no,
I have not seen that
So even
with 11 copies they manage to come to the national level and say that we have not seen that
They are lying, and they are actually deliberately involved And there are some penalties that go up
on this with getting false documents and lying Yes, and it is that there are no legal consequences for these people in the UG And it is not like we go in and see why they do that
They have their own agreements And it is especially when the authorities come and hug the foster mother To the two of these children and have a very close relationship and go close
I would not have behaved like that against such a father But here it looks like a friendship Between a father and a foster mother Yes, and
I think it is very strange that it is not more professional And then you see that loyalty is always the foster mother And here
I have also recorded that the children have talked
on the phone And the children say, they are Muslims And the children say, I eat pig and pig is good And the father says, we do not eat pig, we eat lamb and chicken But not pig, I eat pig and
I think pig is good, I eat sausages And then you see that the children actually provoke And what
I have pointed out here How long have they been in foster home?
It started early, but now
I have been in the hospital for five years And I have talked to the children, they have promised that the children would come home in June And have talked about this, even with a lawyer instead And then suddenly the return of the boy who is locked in foster home But locks the door and opens the door, he has been in the hospital six times now
Then it is said that we will have a new investigation And then comes an order that has not spoken to me or something like that
I am full power for them
So you see that it is broken
all the way And they have had several incredibly bad lawyers And that is something that goes again, that you think you are being
taken away by
a lawyer And then you see that the lawyer this family had, now works in the foster home And has a number of missions for the
Breunnysund area and
such
Where he also works for the foster home But they say clearly that we should win from here, we should stand on the ground But at
least to jump back a little What made me very engaged was after the first meeting
And
I understood that the children will never come home and such So I thought, here we have to go to the media
It was after the first meeting that
I went to NRK Westfold, had with me
both mother and father And we talked a lot and NRK Westfold focused a little on this matter And we said that they were allowed to check and call the child welfare office And what surprised me most was that after they had measured a part of the child welfare team
Then suddenly
I was called in to the child welfare Because then suddenly a concern message came to me Was it from NYV?
No, they had taken up the vaccine case from 2009 And then there was a guy who had used an example
, a letter he had sent to some older people And he was Trønder, he had sent the letter with full name But he had used the old concern message on the vaccine case from 2009 And then they suddenly showed up, it turned out that it was no concern message But then the child welfare started to examine me to get me away from this
Kurdish family
Very professional Yes, it seems that there is so much to do and have the opportunity to
I didn't think it was possible, then suddenly
I started to talk about me and asked to examine And then
I had been through this between two times before, so this time
I said no You are not allowed to talk to the school, you are not allowed to talk to the children, you are not allowed Which is my right, so
I said no But anyway,
they break all the law They contact the NAV, get all the police documents
They contact the police and get the documents that
I didn't know were there once And that was that
I had been a witness for a center in Vestfold in a case when
I was a youth leader So they got the documents, they took me to school without full power and without a foundation And I complained to the police, but they took a very long time And then it happened that they started the investigation in February, it was probably the end of April or the beginning of May
So they were already prepared that this was a case of investigation Against you?
Yes, I had the investigation against my two children And then they took the child's mother to start a child law case against me At the same time as the child's mother case and a hasty child law case
They find the most opportunities to occupy you if you are not at work Maximally yes And that's when you see that it starts to get so absurd And then you see that the lawyers don't go in and say what are you doing Because you understand right after you have been to a center that these lawyers are close friends And they earn money if you win or lose a case, but they have a case that they earn money And that's how it was, because it turned out that the lawyer we used, the Kurdish family
I chose
He was one of the close friends of the child's mother lawyer Close friends Very close friends
So they did these cases, I presented the documentation and the maps they made There was all evidence that was in my case, so
I showed my lawyer, look here Here it goes against itself, here is the law break And then he says, I don't think the other lawyer has seen it And then it goes under a week that the child's mother has withdrawn the child's mother case But they stand as witnesses in the child's mother case And they actually get the professional judge in the child's mother case
He takes on the role of eliminating us, so he takes on his own job And then he comes home to visit, and I had nine witnesses, the district attorney and so on
There were many who stood as witnesses for me, because then
I had to take care of the other case But the case was that this psychologist used the child's mother as the only companion
He dropped all my nine witnesses And then he wrote that
I had some paranoid But he still stopped watching the subscribers of this
He didn't want to see the documentation?
Yes, he read the documentation, he got the documentation, but still he writes He was quite new as a psychologist, and then you get more assignments if you deliver the child's mother, he asks As you can see, all the nine witnesses he was going to tell who
I was and how I was in relation to my child He noticed that and talked to me And even though he got to see the video recording of the Kurdish family
I worked with, and that it was full power for the case
He didn't want to see any evidence It's typical that what they do is look for something that confirms the child's mother's view
They don't want to see the video, other documents, other ways of seeing
things It's like a tunnel vision
, they don't want to see the reality It's like that, and where is the evidence for that?
It's clear that you have to stand firm, and check what is here And I
am a person with a lot of interests And when they came home to me, I had
a studio full of musical instruments And I have a boat that
I have going to the camp, they didn't see anything Even though
I made pictures of what we had done as a family One of them saw vaccines in my house, and that's why it was important to take from me and the children Because
I knew that
I would have something to give them
They don't open up the perspective of what interests they have, music, car, boat, many things It's like, vaccines, okay, just that
There you have the self-reliance And
I see that some of what the child secretary commission, who made the check-in secretary reports, is about That they have to have a wider perspective, that they have to
Not only follow one theory, but also look at alternative ways to understand things And if they haven't done that, then the report is not approved No, and what I am wondering is that we have a child secretary now Who has a research role, is a lawyer, and so on, and then they go in and research
I should say, in a field where they don't have the competence at all And they talk about, for example, the difficult aspect of it with vaccines Then there are people who have never taken this topic and will criticize it And one can say that
I have investigated and proven the connection between the development of the MS
I have and vaccines But they meant to have the knowledge to say that this is just nonsense Even though
I have received documentation from abroad and from all the research
I have done
They have been so well known for that, and that is very admirable Yes, they are overestimating other expertise,
and they don't value it
It is like what
I think it is, it is like that, period And then you can wonder, if they start calling you paranoid, who is actually paranoid
It is quite absurd and not, they are the experts who should have the capacity to do so And then they are completely one-tracked, and they don't want to see anything else And what is shining through is the Norwegian conformity, the fear of being different Experts who dare to claim something that they see in research, they are not those people They are very, they just dry where
others have dried before
I don't know if they have any common competencies at all The point is young people, there was a team leader who started this thing And it is a threat that if you choose to take this for granted, we will go for a medical check-up But we demand that you transfer the medical check-up to the mother When it is a case that has been in the medical check-up and treated there, and the child should live with me
It was 60-40, so it is close to 50-50 But then
they come and try it,
but they are not allowed to take it for granted
I sat with the medical check-ups
at these meetings, I have these problems to show And in a case like this, where a case like this comes with such claims
I lost the main cause of the grief, the mother was killed And that is in itself okay, but
I had no complaints about this for the citizens But they used an incredibly long time, and that was the treatment of the child that
I had complaints about And then the child care center in Tønsberg, the lawyer who had done this illegal thing against me
To pick out the papers that he thought were relevant for the citizen's examination And when the book is closer to the The medical check-up is not allowed And then
I was pretty much the citizen
I asked about different things, because I was well involved in the case And then they said, no, we have not received that We have not received that, can we get a copy of that And then
I have to file all the documents that this lawyer has kept away
from the defendant And in the end
they come
to a conclusion after the child care case was finished That the child care center had broken paragraph 4.3 and
6.4
They had started the case without a basis, and that will be a lot There was almost nothing to get, but this was documented that it was a false case And that they had collected information from all the different media without a basis And then it was broken And I had gone out in the city and visited some places, we filled pictures on the front page And the children were examined and so on, and then
I won And
I sent this to the mayor, and he gave
me a message and we took control of the election What surprised me was that
I went to the And then
I was told that
I had to start a new case against my mother, and that
I would win And then
I was told that
I had used 200,000, and that
I would have to pay 400,000 And that's the system And
I thought that the children were so important that
I didn't want to bother my mother And that
I would lose in this situation, which is also false
So I let it be But the fact that you were holding false documents in court without my lawyer pointing it out And then it turns out that he has not written a case report to deliver in court, so
I thought
I would lose And then you start to see that it is unethical people who get jobs in the child welfare system And their goal is just to win and win And then the question arises that the municipality has been in a rubble for a long time
Under the administration of the mayor for the economy And then you see that the number is around 1.2 million if they take acute care of children And then the municipality has to pay for the help at home if they are going to help the family And therefore we have had
a lot of acute placements here Some say that it has been reduced, but it is more because the refusals have been changed a little
And then
it has been dropped down on the ground You see that the economy is going through Because when you place acute care, the state is paying But if they are going to put in an increase, it is Tønsberg municipality And therefore does not put in an increase
They call it the best of the children, but it is Tønsberg municipality's
best That's what it is about And that is reasonable Yes, and
I think it is difficult, and what is even more difficult is to get this out to the media If you have a child with acute placements, go and tell them that
this is very difficult We do not want to take any action We had
a municipality here in Tønsberg that was very good And then the municipality changed their plan And then they sent the press to choose a small, full-fledged plan But that took a lot of resources to respond to that
So they did not dare afterwards And then the plan was also with fewer announcements if they continue with acute placements That is a lot of pressure Yes, and Tønsbergsblad, which has gotten full access to this, has refused to write about it And I have been to them many times
I have not commented hard on Tønsbergsblad, but
I get a little rose in the middle That says that your posts will not be published in the debate or in the comment section Tønsbergsblad has excluded you from the comment section And they are not interested
in knowing about
these attacks
I have talked to journalists many times and they just complain that we are not allowed to write about it That can only
be called corruption
It is camaraderie Yes, of course
It is Tønsbergsblad that sits as responsible and drives the corruption Yes, and I am very well known in Tønsberg
I know the people around here And I have talked to them many
times about the problem And
I see that they have a scheme That I can be hurt by
this
Or someone who has been out to check And if the answer is no,
they keep quiet So in the beginning many people wanted to know if they could be dragged into this And then you see that politicians and administrations are running a fraudulent game And I don't remember...
There was a case that with one of the citizens came the conclusion that the case was illegal
I was stigmatized in Tønsberg, so
I made the conclusion on my Facebook page And I gave the names of the children's leaders and the team leaders And two days passed The councilor in Tønsberg reported me for harassment by one of them Who was responsible for doing something wrong against me And it was not about trying to clear things up, but about reporting me to the police And this just got more and more wild The new children's leaders were also responsible for following up on this case
So they have taken a screenshot of the comments
I have written and others have written from my side And delivered it to the police And then
I got... this is even
worse
I got a friend request from a man to the children's leaders And I replied, no, so nice and so on I cheered on their wife, she had a little job to do, because I had a lot of faith in the children's leaders Who have now become famous in Norway, but that's another story
So I was very positive And it showed that he had more of a snooker on my side, because
I had pressed the button to put my friend on And he said that
I might have done something wrong, but
I was a bit too high on her But then
I got a phone call where
I really got something out of this child's leader Because
I had contacted
her family And
I tried to give the blame
I got, and say that it was him who contacted me You can get the log
So
I printed this out, and wrote a letter to her And
I explained how you would have judged yourself
If I had written the way you did yesterday
How I would have looked in the mirror and thought about learning from it
There was nothing more than what
I wrote But it didn't take that long
She made a report on me for a harmless offence And then it took about 3-4 days, when she realized that it was her husband who contacted me So she left, but then the leader was told that he wanted to have a visit ban And then
I had to meet the court, and
I didn't know what
I was being told Because she had withdrawn the report And then
I stand there with someone who tries to get a visit ban on me Without me knowing why And in the end, it was about the child's leader, privately And not as an official person The least you can get And I was in charge of the FRP And I wasn't supposed to have any influence on my
political work
I wasn't
supposed to have any influence
on anything
I was allowed to attend And then
I was invited
to a meeting of the selection, because I was in charge of the FRP And the FRP would make a
lot of statements, and
I was interested in that And then
I was invited by the next leader in this election And then
I thought, it's very interesting, we had
many parents who were supposed to go there Who had
a situation with experience from the FRP So
I got a bit of a mental injury, and then
I went to the attack Because then
I had that little visit ban And then
I asked the judge if
I was allowed to attend this meeting
So that there wouldn't be any misunderstanding And he said, of course, you can come there, I shouldn't have anything to say It's written here And then I called the next leader, who had started this And asked if he would do anything
So that there wouldn't be any upheaval in the city hall I'm just going to sit there as a volunteer, I'm not going to do anything And he seemed completely uninterested And I...
I talked to him, but I took care of both To be sure
So I sat behind that hall, and then the children's leader starts playing
a game
She flies out with her phone, and winks and runs The executive leader comes up to me and says that you weren't allowed to be here And I say, yes, I'm not going to say anything, but the executive
leader says that I'm allowed to be here And then
I realized that this is a top-tier And then I sat so far behind that
I could see over the hall, and there were two police officers coming And
I just went out
to meet them, and talked to them We had a good tone of voice And then
I was not allowed to be in that building until 8 days later
I was not in the fight, but
I followed them
So they used me, actually, to misuse the police And the police are ruthless, they also Because when they try to deny the visit to me
They come
with a uniformed police car And then there was a fight
So they flew around this one building
I live in And banged the wall, threw shoes in the window and everything, and shouted outside And I wasn't home
It was almost Sunday, it was a weekend
I think it was Sunday And then they called me and said, hey, I'm from the police
So I answered, are you home?
No, I said, no, are you sure about that?
Yes, I'm in Larvik, so I'm not home Then you have to come to the police station so you can be denied But
I didn't
want to say what it was
They use uniformed police cars in the neighbourhood Yes
,
they are supposed to create problems Stigmatize and silence the police People are not so attentive to how this system is misused
No, and then you see that those who work in the child welfare They enjoy being with the police
They talk together, they have a blue light
As those who are
in this unit are met
So they are friends And it's impossible for the police to start asking critical questions to the child welfare They don't do that, they protect each other And that's why they can misuse this without any consequences It's good that you have seen the reports in Tønsbergblad And around here Both when the municipality gave the information that you were right And how this child welfare chief, or Fischer, how she presents herself as such And how she expresses that she is a victim I feel sorry for her, I need protection They put up a fake facade that they are trusted And that makes it hard for everyone who criticizes the abuse they do Yes, I think that's strange
I have talked several times with the mayor of Tønsberg And the leaders of various political parties Everyone knows
what's going on And I have said that
I would like to be part of it
I have been at these elections for over two and a half years And I have been part of the political management of the child welfare But they pretend that
I am not there
I see that
there are many who are there And they don't want dialogue
I have told them that
I can meet them anytime to find out what has happened And give the documentation, but they are not interested
They just let the child welfare authorities
to do what they want And after
I have seen the budget, more and more people are coming
Because there is no insight in the child welfare budget But in Lille Tønsberg, I think it's worth 190 million kroner That's
a lot No one knows where the money goes
How much goes to the lawyers And here we have a municipal
director who says straight We don't make a budget, we only have a light version Because no politician wants to read the budget And that means that no one has control over the child welfare service And the money can flow to whoever wants it And here we have a business leader who has his own foster children And has had it for a year Are we business leaders in child welfare?
Yes, you have an organization where you have child welfare leaders And above child welfare leaders there are business leaders And then the municipal director comes And then the council comes And the council chief gives the child to the business leader Yes, and he enjoys that
So that they get
economic benefits from that Yes, of course
And there we had a case in 2009, I think
Where the friend of the business
leader had taken care of a child And it got a bit messy
around that And then it was said straight from the municipal director
That I can confirm that she is not a foster mother The child was sitting
on the foster father Or her husband
So that was not the case And now she is also the one who is looking to become a municipal
director After the one who has been here now
So it is a very
short bond And
I think that if they are going to have a child welfare service
Then there must not
be so many child welfare employees Can have their own foster children Who let their own be, but they just get them in From the neighboring municipality and so on And you see that in many cases now
This is organized
It is the human hand Yes, that is it
They use each
other's friends to get an income And there they increase the human hand
They
take the child on a very thin basis many times
Placed in places with friends and acquaintances And then one thing is that these friends get
an economic advantage But these friends also
put themselves in a re-election situation
To those
who have given them this advantage Yes, of course And there corruption and camaraderie appears Yes, then you see that there are some former employees in the child welfare Who are starting to sell child welfare services Or private institution places or something like that And when there is no will to start looking at where the money goes Of 190 million And a municipality that has been under the official administration Like Råbæk Then it is strange that the mayor also chooses to close his eyes And one thing that
I was very surprised by
That they say that they have complaints in the child welfare That you can complain to the mayor But in the case that
I said myself that
I had complained to the mayor
It turned out that
I was not part of their own business
No And it is strange that the child welfare has done illegal action against me But because the mayor is the one who should monitor the child welfare service But at the same time has a duty to guide in relation to the child welfare service
It should not be done against anyone Yes, here are those who are teachers who should evaluate and so on And then
I am not part of their own business
And
they are informed that they have done illegal action against you But it has no consequences for them Because it will only happen to close the gaps that have been found But to clean up in it, that should be okay
I have seen several places where the child welfare does wrong Then it is called a gap While when a parent does wrong Then you lose the child And that's what
I think is strange When you have got a legal case, you have got a fine of 240,000 in
lawyer's fees and so on And it is not surprising that after it was found that the case was illegal
Then the child welfare service and the lawyer they had asked the mother to use in the child welfare case
Went to the name man
So
I got a requirement to pay in the 100,000 per rap or else they would take my house After it was found that everything was illegal And then this becomes for ordinary people
That
...
It is strange to say it is mild
I was in contact with a family in the neighborhood Where they saw a lot of the same
Where they went to take the child And they ended up with forcing themselves to the house And a lot of groups And then they got some of these children
back So the neighborhood began to lose And they saw the same community as the Bonaire case And we all know how it went Yes Right?
So that it is the whole system
It seems like they think they can do as they want Yes, but it can do a lot for itself too When you see that... But it did not get consequences No, it was not in the order of the organization If you are going to ride a moped, you have to have the moped
license
If you ride too fast, you lose the license
But for those
who are not going to go in and evaluate and take away from people children
If they make a mistake, it is the system's fault
There is never any consequence for the one who does it And even if there is a person who has a personal reason and wants to take away others
Then they can abuse that power in a position in the child welfare system
Without having
any consequences And the police of course choose to close their eyes
Because they are very well informed in Tønsberg And they are so well informed that when the child welfare system suddenly made a lot of false reports on me That I
should have said that
I wish someone would kidnap a child welfare system
That is what happened in Davla But the whole thing was that there was a comment field on Facebook
Where
there was a report for a warning article And where I in a kind of heart attack say that
I wish that the child welfare leaders Could kidnap their child so that they understand what they are doing to
others Because I said it, I was in the police station for many years ago And there we were pushed down in Sørland We did not get food, we did not get sleep We felt on our own body So that we would never put on another soldier more than this cake itself We should know how heavy and tired And then you see that this is people who have gone through a simple education Who have never been in such a stressful situation Who have never felt the stress of being examined by strangers who go everywhere And that fear and stress you get
They have never tried it themselves And as simple as that, I would like that some kidnap police to come and get the child welfare leaders And put them on the And let them be there from
Friday to Monday and talk to the family that now you have to take the children
So that they can sit on the That the brain flies out and they sleep poorly and see how they react It should be minimum requirement And that was what was in the setting
I have no interest at all that you should take the child When they react in that way That they escalate them to visitation And reporting, kidnapping plans
Then they are rather desperate Really Yes, because
I think the most important thing for all child welfare leaders is to collect information And information means reduction of uncertainty And the first thing to do if you have seen this We have taken a screenshot and sent it to the police
They could call me and say that you are planning What do you mean by that comment, because it looked a bit strange And then
I could explain what the background was
That
I have the background of being tested hard And
I think it should be
a requirement and also a recommendation from the child welfare But it is not personal property at all So you can be very unsuitable
for such a job And still sit well
So there is nothing more than that Was there a comment to me also said That they are putting together that they want to kidnap And it is a completely different discussion A completely
different day and week
Where
I will come up with a comment that
There is a question of when not about
It will happen And it was also a discussion, a long discussion with about 40 comments Where
I say that when the child welfare is caught in this
way
Then it is just a question of when they hit one Which does not give birth to children voluntarily
without resistance And that is just a possibility And therefore
I have also said that the child welfare officer in Horten Signed, but he contacted
me
, he wanted to meet with me And he pulled me in as soon as he understood what
I was talking about
So
I must confess that he actually did something else
That had to be done to me Because he had also said, look here, it's about you too Had he been presented for it
to be just several who signed
So they blow up nothing really What they do is try to demonize the critics
To make it, what should
I say, laugh, make it dangerous
Slash them away
Try to create an impression among other people
That
this is some nonsense, do not listen to them Yes, of course And that's how they do it And that's what
I think is very strange
I am very fond of a good child welfare officer
I am fond of the fact that today we have so many
I have to take care of myself, so I want you to help me with the children But I can not do that daily care And then you should be
able to help the children to find a foster home But then you see that if the children have been
taken
It is impossible to get them
back Because now the connection to the new home is so good That it is encouraging for the children
to come back And it's these
I react to because
I have been in front of the child welfare But then
I see that it has been misused
This connection is something they misuse extremely
I do not think they understand the concept of living long with someone
A child connects to all the care staff
they have And it has different connections to mother, to father And the child also connects to violent parents
So that the child is strongly connected, even the child welfare commission says so
It is completely irrelevant
It is the quality of the connection Because the connection is the way the children respond in the environment they are in And of course, if a child lives with a whole family
Then it is a little different from if the father and mother are in the nursing home
It is completely different
environments But regardless of the environment, it can be alcohol, it can be sports, it can be car The child gets a connection and it goes hand in glove with the environment And if the environment is bad, then the quality of the connection is negative But if the environment is good, then the quality of the connection is positive But
all children connect It is completely irrelevant, it is silly to say that now they have connected so strongly to the foster parents That they can not move back
It is a misuse of the concept The quality, you saw the movie you mentioned Where
he throws himself on the throat on his skin
The Kurdish family
It is a positive connection And if they claim that the children have connected to the foster parents It can well be that But it is not harmful to move back to the parents Because there the connection is good too Right?
And that's what
I find strange When the children are in a situation where they are new in Norway And they need guidance for a lot But they have to work together 2 times 2 hours a year And then the children are told to look at the mirror with their eyes
If you want them to break up the connection If you are afraid, you say that All possible to make sure that the children are safe before they meet their parents That is not safe, that is to put the children in fear Yes, right And when you can not show joy You can not run towards the children and show great joy You should wait for the children to have contact
Then the children will experience this And this is also in the report How to ensure the children before meeting
And this
Kurdish family
There they have done everything to break the relationship The son has been very concerned about the phone
So he wants a touch phone to calm And parents who do not have much money
They bought this
touch phone to him And as
a gift to the other two children And
then they deliver it to the children The father said that he would take this The boy said that she never delivered it And then the boy begins via the grandfather Because they had a little contact with the family And then says, I have not received it You lie to you And then they come to me with the receipt I say, we have paid, but they have not received it And then
I call the sales assistant And she says, no, we do not have it And then finally
I went out in the city notice
It was the
end of February, we were supposed to meet in the airport
And then
I say that she refuses to give her phone
Then
I call the sales assistant to get the phone But then the boy has been irritated
He has not released the phone
He had been
looking forward to getting it for two months And it had to be so strong evidence to go to the notice And it shows that this is not something that happens by chance And I am not aware of it,
I have no relation to them More than
I was better off helping them Now I know them well But that the sales assistant can do this And I see that this happens in many cases You send the children to...
It is direct counter-work of a positive relationship to the parent
They are taken away by the gift that the children look forward to And that the parents are happy to give to the children And then they use...
It is the opposite of the children's best Yes, and here in Trønsberg we had another case that
I have been involved in Where it was directed to a parent conflict where the children were in a bad mood And then they suddenly come and pick up the children on May 16 And then everything
was done by
May 17 And then when the father ran away, what happened?
And then they just answer that they don't care about the parents The children care about us And then the children are placed in a nursing home where there was also a conflict And this they know about in the child care system
This they know about in politics But they refuse to take it And this is a patient in the nursing home And the caretaker in the nursing home has called us He has called the child care system
many times He calls back, but they don't call back They don't
want to talk with...
And this is what is...
This in Trønsberg is now starting to become
a big gap Between the healthy sister
who has lost a lot of trust When the child care system complains that it was too few concerns from the healthy sister
Doctors in the nursing home and so on, they refuse very much And there should be trust You should know that there is quality in the led with the child care system That you don't cause more problems for the family than it should have been
It is quite clear that Trønsberg, the child care system and also the warden and the rest of the responsible They have a serious problem here Yes, and the fact that they don't want to and refuse Because I have had good contacts in the political environment And they went so far that the warden took away the child care system And removed her from the election as child care system But then she blamed me for being
a refugee But she had changed the child care system, stepped up in the media about the child care system many times But she took her to another place
So one of the reasons is that the child care system is a holy cow Which you don't want to straighten up and get close And the question is why
It is maybe time to start to drive more against these people
There is no reason to be so stubborn Because they break the Norwegian law And humanity is like that And there are many types of children who have also stated that
There are many other types of children who have not been
able to agree with the child care system
Who are dependent on this income and therefore sell themselves out in all their competences In Judaism Yes, that is the case And when you hear this time and again And that nothing is happening, then it must be political wish
It must be if it is an attack on the family as an institution
So that you scare everyone else to the point of being trampled Because you see that there are often resource-weak people who...
Who are hoping for these things And when you see that it has started a part of the foster home intermediaries Who give two-thirds to the foster home and one-third to themselves And of course if a child can be taken straight from the nursery And 18 years with 10,000 kroner is put in the intermediary In the month, then of course you don't want to give back that child Which then has an addition and not an addition to the family And we have some companies here in Tønsberg who are also running, organized in this way
It may be time to start to...
To end this, to start to name these, what they really do But then you see the red thread through this
That you see that this is quite serious
Yes, it is, and many have
fought with the social network Some of the former workers in Tønsberg can be good for close to 100 million kroner Now it is because they have done something And it is not necessarily that it is charity that they do Because it is a
lot of money, you see, the glass girl case
Only 28,000 in the days you got for
an institution, but a glass girl from
Stavanger
Then you understand that it is unlimited resources And then it is a little easy if you can take it And I don't understand the competitive character in the nationality and things That the children can
be proud of winning a case
They have
lost their way, they were not able to do their job But anyway
, they go with the high-level that we won And then you wonder which person you have to trust
It must
be
a special type of person, because the empathy disappears in that type of case
There are completely different things that control it
It is I who should win that actually controls the foundation of this system
Because when you start
criticizing them, they are suddenly victims And then they use all the tricks they can to keep you at a distance Find a concern report against you and give you an invitation Yes, we saw that in Tønsberg Our child welfare manager said that we did not feel heard
It is written in the media on this page With a big picture with a bowed neck and so on And then suddenly it is written in Dagblad with one of Norway's most expensive lawyers Who will confront the child welfare where the child welfare officer stands behind a glass wall With his legs crossed and says that he is very scared And then it comes here in the local press that the child welfare officer is very scared And then it stands triumphantly together with one of the leaders in the police That now we will take it seriously And then he is smiling And then you see that this is a massive organized campaign
A PR campaign that is being run here Yes, and you had visited
Dagblad who gave you
a big picture
I had
Dagblad in the journalists for three and a half hours
I think And I
gave him a lot of information, I gave him a lot of information And then he said that you will probably be very disappointed when you see what
I write now Because this is determined how it should be And then
I had, I have learned a little about this game
When he said that this will be negative
That
I will be disappointed, I contacted him later And said that if you choose to portray me as something else than what I am and what
I have shown you
Then
I will put the entire video recording of our interview
on YouTube And
then
I was not shown any pictures of me as
I was shown of you
I was not shown any pictures of you, I was just the man from Tønesberg And then I was stopped there And that's not how it should be Because the journalist should be like, what is this for?
And then he should dig into what we are trying to say And then he should say that there is one straight paid media Because it was not by chance that so big as Dagblad came out Or Yrkesblad to the children's world at the same time And then Tønesbergsblad Three places at the same time, then it is paid media And who is paying that media, then is it Tønesberg with such bad news?
And why do they do that?
We must, and
I just want to say it completely clearly
I am very fond of a good children's world Where the children are taken in and they are treated fairly But you have to get the law, they have to follow the law They have to keep to the human rights, they have to get the expertise in place Because now it is, I do not regret that the more you dig, the more snusk it is Tricking and mixing, economic,
strange dispositions
If they are known, they use the police against those who criticize themselves Then they use the municipal resources against the residents It stinks all the way We had Solveig Horne here in Tønesberg, I think it was March 15, 2015
There were a lot of people in the town hall, who came up with different stories And she said that this is completely wrong And then she would send her But nothing happened, she promised that here she would take care of this And we have been on Stortinget and put this forward And we have been
on seminars on Stortinget together But there is a political unwillingness And the question is why is that?
Because everyone in Norway believes It reminds me a little of the English series, I Well Staltz Or something like that, do you remember?
Where Staltz and the real Bagvan Nikkedukker get the bureaucratic power that was behind You can start to wonder, you see Horne, she was very critical And then she comes into position to do something
But then there is something that slows down And
I guess you have Trommald, who sits on Bufte You have
F.O. The child welfare organization
They sit with power and control the municipalities The question is what political ideology is
behind Because we have heard in the Kurdishak That the state is talking about the state's children
That the children in foster homes are being treated like state children And then there is the political ideology that most of Norway wants Which is overrepresented in the child welfare
So
I do not know But
I sit here for a
little over an hour
I think we could talk
until morning
So maybe we should start to discuss a little
I think it is important that more
people
start to discuss these issues
But this will not continue
I think it is important that family, relatives and friends are not tested
You see that they are labeled as unauthorized or not authorizable Without checking anything You can not talk to them once And then it stands here And that the child welfare can register people We have a municipality next door Where you have to take three old children And have a very thin reason to take them And only two or three days before the court comes The child welfare manager reports the father for sexual abuse of this three-year-old Even though it is written in the paper that it is in the nursing home
That has
happened But then it has only anonymized the parents and delivered to the police The police then take care of it Three or four days later, but then the justice is over And the judges have no option then And then the children are sent back to the parents When there is a report from the child welfare It is a mess And this family here They lost their daughter on the outskirts And then they lost their grandchildren to the child welfare And then they manage to hire a person named Breivik But in all documents it says Breivik And the court is called Breivik And then it has this story
So this is inconspicuous And it should have been true and true And it is this that it enjoys For one reason or another, it enjoys and tortures And in this case the parents who cry It is sadistic over this
I think so
Enjoy the suffering in the name of sadism And then it happens The court is always sitting with a phone And takes selfies of themselves in the court Without the judges reacting And I don't understand that And the sexual assistant also in the court Who is accused of being a lawyer And then the judge says that they have not seen it Why is it such a justice system if it should be That it should be presented in a different way The trust disappears to the whole system And then it starts to be half a year And then people
start to look for justice elsewhere Yes, that's what I'm most worried about
I am a totally non-violent person myself And therefore
I think it is very special
To be the one who should be in danger
So that the child care center goes with violence and alarm
I met her at the store when we greeted each other But outside the media
Then she is very afraid
They are playing a game Yes, yes, yes And when I am shopping at the local rematose store over there And the child care center is standing in the door and talking And I wait to go in but
I stand in the door I walk right past and then
I say hello And then we walk past each other and talk to each other so many times And instead of just ending the matter
Then she goes out in the media after what's going on Everywhere and that doesn't happen They are playing a game to get victims Yes, and then it should go
That the media is actually involved I'm
a little scared because
then they talk about fake news
And those who are massing fake news And those who promote these things
So I'm very happy with the child care center
I have come to my own opinion
Is that the child care center must
be shared
It should
only be a helping organization Who should not go into research
It must
be
a police case
Then there is violence, sexual abuse and so on Which is punishable for the role
Then it is the police who will investigate it And then the child care center should get the right to work
Help the families at home Put to the right So that you don't get this competition And being king in court and so on With such a short education And without
any requirements
It is actually a higher requirement than a mob
Than it should be so true And with those words
I think we thank you for us here today We have
gotten
a little insight into
Maybe especially what is happening here in Tønsberg But also what is actually happening on the other side Because there is very
similar dynamics around this
So we say thank you to Tønsberg Today is the name And we will be back again
Thank you

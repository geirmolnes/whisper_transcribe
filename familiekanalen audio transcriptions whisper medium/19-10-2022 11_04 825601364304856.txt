 My name is Torune Fardal.
And today we have a breaking case.
It's an appeal for human rights in the case of Silje Garmo in Poland.
Silje Garmo, a Norwegian mother, had to escape from
Norway
due to the employee in the Soviet to the employee in the Norwegian CPS Barneverne who for no reason wanted to take her daughter away from her.
Silly Garmo is a strong capable mother.
She escaped to Poland and applied for asylum and tomorrow 22nd of June is the deadline for the Polish Foreign Ministry to answer her request.
Silly has great support for her case in Poland and Norway and in many European countries.
In a video today she appealed to all of you to support her case and she have a clear message that today the Norwegian government and Barneverne is after her but tomorrow they may come after you.
We here in the Family Channel support Silly and her case against the behavior from the employee in the Norwegian Barneverne.
Let's hear what Silly has to say in her video today.
Polish people
I call upon you today to stand up and take a stand in this matter because this matter concerning me and baby Aira now today might concern you and others in the future because this topic is such important because this touches you know the fundamental values, basic rights and also the fundamental principles of the Polish Constitution.
Let the children, let the children, let the children be set free.
No way, no way, no way.
You just heard
Silly Garmo asking for your help.
I suggest we all help her against the Norwegian Barneverne.
Let's hope she get the asylum tomorrow 22nd of June and that this will be a clear message to the Norwegian government and Barneverne in how they treat families and children.
Thank you for watching this message from Silly Garmo in Poland.
We here in Family Shell will follow this case and give you an update on new developments.
Thank you.

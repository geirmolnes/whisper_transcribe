Hei hej sammen, velkommen til for my
kanalen
Idag skal vi ta opp nokket interessant tema
Sedan sattar over till studio I've been to other familiar places I've been running like a sentence Never
begun I've been looking for a way To let you know I've been running like a sentence Never
begun I've been running like a sentence Never
begun I've been looking for a way To let you know I've got nothing left to fill the spaces
I've got nothing but a center Come and I'm
done I've been doing circles And it shows, it shows
Avocado in the sky Avocado place is that
I hide
I was wrong to let you go
Every sound that
I hear
Every thought that
I fear
Tell me that
I, I was wrong
I was wrong to let you go I've had a conversation with them An interview with them a while back About the problems with the children
Up in Neustadl, among other things And Heidi, you've been again
Attached
to the children's, what shall we say Terror against you actually Was it Thursday Where you got the message that Both your son and daughter were
Going to school and the kindergarten Can you tell us what happened on Thursday?
On Thursday
I sent Christine to school With the school bus as usual
I was on my way to work And took my brother, Kristoffer To the kindergarten as usual Delivered everything
as usual
I don't know what's going on there And around 12 o'clock
I was called up From the police In the kindergarten?
In the kindergarten And was asked to come to the police station
Did they say they were helping you?
I was supposed to come to a station And I asked why
I was supposed to come to this station And then
I was told by the police That the children were taken And they were on their way to Bergen To the kindergarten in Bergen And that the kindergarten in Førrede Was being registered for water protection For the children
To such a large extent that it was a risk of life and health Ok, so it was a risk of life and health Before we started filming
I've seen these two children here for a few hours
while we were eating And they don't carry any signs of water protection They have enjoyed the water, they have laid
They have been up to something completely normal What was it that you went to this police station?
Yes, I travelled for work
Came to the police station And was met And yes
Then it was that
they wanted a A And that these children were now at the kindergarten in Bergen And that these children were then to be registered
For another police officer
So he was there, then
I got a message But we didn't know where the children went We didn't know
where they had reacted We didn't know who had been with We didn't know anything But
I then demanded that
I have a lawyer instead Because it turned out that
There were no registered police lawyers for us Did you get a lawyer for the children?
Yes Were there any lawyers you got names from?
We got every name on our heads But that was after
I had contacted a lawyer
So then we managed to arrange it so that The lawyer was involved in that But there were very few who came forward
It was very diffuse What did you feel
they tried to dig after?
They probably wanted to dig deeper Because
I understand that you had
received an anonymous Anonymous concern report that this was built on Yes, I was told that it was that The children's rights activist had received an anonymous Concern report
So I was in such a bad state That it meant it was a life-threatening thing for the children And then the children were at school And in the kindergarten And then they said it was a life-threatening thing Yes, and they had been there every day And there was nothing of the sort
Had the school or the kindergarten given
any indication
That there was something wrong here?
No And the children had not even investigated the kindergarten Not with the school, nothing
They had not even contacted them
They had not done
anything to investigate And as
I said, we had just a week since our conversation Parents' talks, both in kindergarten and in school
Nothing No, Christopher had been at the health center There was no concern And we just got a message back that it was a very nice development Everything went normally
He had a nice weight And what was the description you referred to?
What did they actually fish for?
Did you get any feeling?
It was very diffuse What he said was that
I could tell about the family's routine in the home
Open questions like you wash yourself You can give yourself if you really have done something
Typical police method Create a supply
first
Then they take you out It was very diffuse But after a while there were strange things That the children had had dinner
It was observed that they had been out The time was 2-3 pm How old are they?
Christopher is 4 and she is 7
So some had assumed that
they were out for 2-3 hours And we had left him Christopher, we had left him And he was not allowed to be in the shop
He had to be at home It was very clear that every time we were driving
It was perceived that we only traveled to the shop
It was not talked about, maybe it was something else
It was very concrete things
That you drove to the shop and he was not with you It must
be very
close if someone has seen anything How did they know you were at the shop?
We had reacted
I saw after a while he The police Yes, then it took to hear Are you sure you have taken the right person today?
Are you sure you checked this?
Yes, I was completely taken out of the blue Yes Yes, no But he sat very, I felt very that he just wanted to end this
He didn't want to
I felt that
he actually began to understand that
There was no consistency in this Yes, I sat very,
I felt that he was very clear that The child welfare had done a terribly bad job
This was taken out of the blue
That feeling
sat very with He was very clear that the child welfare had not done their preliminary investigation
It was in the police then that we had talked with both the children's school And he was completely honest that there was nothing of concern
They probably
have contacted
, they picked up
at school Then you have to talk to some teachers
Probably explained that they had to take it with them And the same on the day of the child And no one there had actually seen any reason for concern And then they suddenly come and claim concern
It is completely typical child welfare in Førde and Nævstal Every
time
I go up to a case that will come up in about three weeks You are going to court or you are going to court against the child welfare Then they will count one after another if it is so, it is one or the other
This time they tried to get a gray friend
So they tried to actually You were on the day trial What did you experience that they actually asked for Were you the same?
I just looked at the computer and thought that now it's three weeks
I was going to court, so then I understood what it was So I didn't take it very much, but when
I realized that
they had
taken my
children
Then I was a bit disappointed, so to speak Then
I reacted with I don't know what happened, so to speak
I just wanted to know what was written in the concern report How long did you sit in the job?
It was an hour maybe
I was
I think not more than half an hour
Maybe 50 minutes
I didn't take long What happened after that?
Did you get arrested or what happened?
I was informed that if this came to you at the orphanage Then the report was extended to the police And we could restrict the prison The orphanage is a place where you talk to children
To get them to tell where the so-called proportional is sitting and talking to them
So what we were informed about
It was that we were going to come
back
It was three o'clock, it was about an hour and a half later And when we were on our way back
Then I called the acquaintance and said We haven't got any concerns about this
So we didn't have to come
It was extended to an hour and a half And that's how it actually went The half hour went out the whole afternoon At least it was four and a half And then
I called the Fjordelandsbarnsmotor And said that the whole auction was cancelled The police have made everything dead
There is nothing, they find nothing at the orphanage Nothing at all is in the orphanage And that the orphanage was going to contact and tell what How the children had it But that
didn't happen You didn't hear anything from the orphanage at all?
No, we didn't hear anything at all They didn't answer the phone when the lawyer called It didn't mean a lot of good conscience?
No, because they had to decide Because this went their way, they had planned this You think this anonymy comes from someone in this system?
Yes It was just a plan
It was exactly as
I expected
It was a plan the day before It's going to happen
soon It's strange that nothing has happened before
That they find something to discredit And then there is Roar Vegsund who is the municipal lawyer And we completely expect that the orphanage Had contact with Vegsund And that they have done everything
to make sure this is
going to happen
This is what he decided It's not impossible to think that the lawyer Vegsund And the children's circle felt that someone had a finger in this
I know, I'm not sure Did you get a feeling when they asked you
Did you see the concern?
I didn't see everything
They would have been really upset And they have been terribly concerned We have the feeling that
In these four or five years
this has been
going on
It has been in the child welfare sector all the way Both in Neustad and Førde In a way that they will destroy our lives They will harass us
They will bully us They can't stand that you have a criticism of them No, I don't think that's wrong And that came out clearly when they came back with the children
I was going to pick up the children in Førde And when
I confronted the children with That there has been
a serious assault on the family And that this is a crime of investigation
Then he said, over the phone
Then the head of child welfare in the Førde municipality That if
I started to provoke the children with the fact that they had broken the law Then they
won't be able to deliver the children back So you were threatened?
It was a serious threat Because this got consequences for you Ronny?
Yes, I got consequences for me
Because I was going to have a run-up on Friday on the trailer And then
I didn't make it
I didn't make it that far
Did you get any other consequences?
Work and everything,
there are of course many consequences that play in here They were going to
take on Monday with the children
They promised halfway that they would sort this out And when they came back with the children The only thing the children were concerned about Was that we were going to put two lines over this As if it had never happened
I had waited for one and a half or two months to get on the trailer And that day, as if it was planned that everything would happen And then you were told that you were going to get them back to work And that we were thrown out of the town
They took
everything we owned
And there was never any concern for the children when
they were thrown out of the house on December 22 And they threw and burned everything we owned
Then no one was concerned
They actually construct concerns here?
Yes, they do, it is 100% certain And
I think it is quite serious, because they had deceived Christine at school And said that she was going to be with her teachers to Bergen Because they were going to a course You told me
earlier that when they
came to school and the kindergarten Neither teacher nor kindergarten manager wanted to give the children out And that they were with the children, right?
Yes, I have spoken
to the kindergarten manager And she was very clear that he was going to have a safe person with her And that she was going to be with her So the kindergarten manager did not get the opportunity they did last time
To be able to influence the children
On their way to Bergen
So the kindergarten teacher was there to teach the children to be with the children
So that the kindergarten teachers could sit there and tell them what they were supposed to say
It is scary that you have to fear, it is manipulation, revenge I see it so seriously in this When it came to the kindergarten teachers in the Sognefjord Not necessarily in the Sognefjord Now we know that
Stryna had
some serious
problems Sogndal had some serious problems
There even happened with Dødsfall Neustal knows the whole world And Neustal happened to the whole world
So
I actually think that it is risky for parents to send their children to school and kindergarten
It has become so serious in the Sognefjord That one can risk that one sends the children to school without guilt And that one never sees them again
So if it is
like this, the community believes that there is an anonymous concern report
So they don't know who has sent And it leads to an acute warning That they place the children at once It is so simple, then anyone can do it, they are not hungry anymore Anyone can do it If you don't like a neighbor, you just send a concern report And then they have to react to an acute warning After you sent the children to school, how late did they get home?
9.30
in the evening
Then they had been
traveling through Bergen, it was a pretty
long drive At least 3-4 hours
with ferry and bus The first thing Christine did was lock the door And lock the windows
They reacted to it, and that must have been done Yes, of course, there was a reaction
She was up
at night and had to check if the door was locked That it didn't come out of the car The children have a fear in these children Because if you are so young that you are picked up You want to be first, I want to talk to mom and dad That's what they probably said first Now Christine knows that she took her three siblings in 2013
She remembers it and never forgets it
She talks about it every day
There is a latent fear What does she think when she goes to school on Monday?
Will they pick me up today?
That's what we learned from Bonario and the children
They didn't dare to live in Norway anymore Because they feared that they would come now And they had to leave
I think that the child welfare manager
He has been in the hospital for so many years
Should have such knowledge That you can't just put two lines over a such attack And then
I think when he can say such things as child welfare manager
Then the competence is not there to have such a job You can wonder what they really think
They have to understand that the children get a reaction When they just leave
Without having talked to mom and dad Or got an acceptance to leave
So Karin says that we have nothing to do with the town council She works in the child welfare in Føyde And there have been the other children But the town council took back the case After I got a visit But they have nothing to do with it
So they are the same district attorney And that is
Roa Veisund And he will give the case to me in three weeks The whole
thing is a plant
It is a provocation to discredit But now the police could not use it They can not use it
at all If they mention it in court, it will be back on you
Roa Veisund is probably the judge to use this And nobody should tell me that when the child welfare in Føyde Did this attack and sent them to the child welfare That they have not had contact with Veisund Then I am their attorney He is the district attorney But he has not been a district attorney
He should have been
a mayor Veisund also has a bad history in the stream He was a district attorney for Neustadal when
Bodnarjo left
He starts to get a lot of things on him He starts to look
a bit like Bjørn Lave in the mountains
He has a bad history in Halvangerveien The car slipped out But there are also other things That happened to him, the district attorney It was not a research on him But some kind of economic investigation
He had an economic investigation on some fish industry And a mullet shop
He is a district attorney The municipalities should be very critical Of course he has a responsibility for what
happens legally And he should be defending child welfare He should soon be in the car
He has been against you in the case of Neustadal In five years now Where they are trying to put you on the ground Yes, to those degrees
So he should be out of the system
soon
But
I also think that the police have seen that child welfare is a new attack
So
I think that the police should be able to be so mature
That they give child welfare a little more attention Child welfare has to lose some credibility
At least if these police people take themselves seriously When these old ladies
come running
We have to get these children, drive them to Bergen Mostly it is the same police officers and police lawyers Who handle the case
, so they are doing everything against the children
It was not the police before that came
No, it was the police from
Strindorf The police before had
declared themselves in the car But she was a police lawyer in the case
Inge Bertforsen She has
had
both child welfare cases in the Neustadal
She
had
been
forced to go to the house in the Neustadal But she was not mature enough to declare herself in the car She was playing her game
She gave gas
It is good that the children can get away
a little We are sitting on the river And here is the sun on the way down
It was 16 degrees in the water
I think I'm waiting
a little longer It is probably all the way to the top, maybe 10 cm And then it falls quickly
It usually happens on the river What do you think now?
This must have consequences for both child welfare in the Neustadal and the municipal lawyer
It is a doubt that they have had a finger in this game
It is possible to take this in some other way for them We have found out that they have collaborated with
They have made a false
complaint here Cooperation from two others
I will not say much about it now, because we will talk about it on Monday But that is what has happened in this whole case
It will have consequences
for the child welfare service and those who have done it I am very excited now about if the child welfare service is so suitable for adults That
they themselves manage to convey their deviation And further into the municipality That they are so suitable adults to take
I do not think so
, they are just followed up If I know you correctly, you will give the municipality a clear message That they will follow up How did you get back to school?
They came back the same day on Thursday Were they at school and the children on Friday?
No, we stayed here, we did that in the meeting
It was late and they were
They needed to get back the faith that their parents were
So now it is just on Monday Put the screws on and get
rid of in the road to the child welfare service And the municipality lawyer Vegsøen Who obviously has
a finger in the game
They have never put two lines above this
This is actually a tracassering
Because regardless of whether there is a message
They
could have done
this in a different way
They do it in a very thoughtful way And they can not use the engine either
This is something that the children have made and developed themselves And so that now they try the next case
They use this here
So that they had the map and
got this one more Yes, you can see that They could have been put in prison if these children had said anything Or that the police had not found out what had happened Because we understood how stupid it was It was just a matter of time when it happened But what happened we did not know It was actually important that these children had
two people
with them Take no bullshit
If they had been alone in the car with one of these children
Then we have to assume that they had been affected by you
They did that to the other children they took from me
They had not said
much to the judges When they came in the car and they were to drive them away from here
They had
told everything in the car To the children's school
They had told
in the car Not to the judges, but in the car And that the court left
on It's the fjord with the Tingeret We will also avoid that
Tingeret Which city is it located in?
It's in Fødde We have told them clearly that the case should not be about the fjord with the Tingeret
It just has to come out of the whole country It's so corrupt with the child care and the police That he does not belong there at all No, it's scary
I really do not understand that they dare When you see now The child care manager was kicked out of the school Well helped by the way he treated
Ken Johar and Vibeke
I have been in contact with several who have had the same child care manager And they tell many years back That he has not been a very good person to do To say the least
So that it But it does not get any consequences for the people
They were moved into the municipality Yes, and that's where
I think that here the politicians And here the rule-making
must be done With one another The mayor came to the conclusion that
I should meet these young people That
I had to meet them and send a letter to Monica Lohen-Grove at Nævstall She was fine with something else But the mayor got so long that
I needed help
It was not enough that you needed
help But you should go to a therapist
She has explicitly written that you should go to a therapist And you should admit that you have been violent to the children
So you are free of charge But she forces you to go to a therapist
I noticed that that dog Lohen
Her name is Monica Lohen-Grove Is not kicked
So she completely She is totally out of this
Bonaro case And
then the same brainwashing gang continues Yes, but she is going out
To make problems, problems, problems For many You are not the only
ones up there
Other families have experienced her Many Sick people, of course But
I think to use that pressure against a father That you should admit something that you are free of charge
Before
meeting your children
It means that they really have nothing But if you admit, they have something
It's totally crazy What happens on Monday?
Then we go to the children's office in Førde As we were supposed to be on on Friday
, as they did not want us to come
Then it will be good, I will tell the truth, I will say what we have done
Take the lawyer and go out Maybe not take the lawyer, but Take Pelig Eno and tell him that he is very aware of what he is doing
He is for a type
They have made a lot of sense
I think they should be aware that they are actually repairing this It's not enough to just put two lines over this
Now they have made a lot of sense and then they can clean up after that
It does not do that, it never does But they will, but so obviously lost where the police have been
Handled
this, and said that there is nothing
Then it starts to come a little backwards
Then they should not be so very tough in the conversation
Because then it hits back, then it will be a good bargain
It will be easy
It will be
easy, it will be
Then you have heard how the children's office in Førde and Naustal They are pretty close in the close quarters How they continue to track this family We have previously had an interview, you can see on the family channel
Where
they explain a little more what
they experienced that time
Then we hope that someone understands the drawing up there The advisor in Førde actually has responsibility for those who work in
Førde
So the child care manager and those who work there
They should soon begin to
take care What do you think?
Yes, they should start doing it They do not necessarily agree to work with children And
I also think that he is a good man, should be a good adult
That
he contacts us and tells
us what the consequences are What the municipality wants to do as a consequence
I think that is the least we can ask But
I have very little doubt about what will
happen They are not adults enough, they are fast enough to drag down people But when they have to clean up after themselves, it is not so tough anymore As long as they are good themselves, then they can deal with other children
It is clear that all of you out there and the opinion must rise
Because what
this family experiences, many people experience in many places in the country And all of you out there have more power than you think If you give clear message to these municipalities
Then these responsible in the municipality, what they actually do That they break both human rights, the best of childhood What is allowed and rules And then it is not useful as a child welfare manager and a councilman in the previous trials
To put two lines over this, we forget this
This will not be forgotten, this will be filled up So we will see what happens next week and the week ahead We will keep you oriented and then the sun is about to go down And
an
island out here in Nordstøn We say thank you for us here and then the Family Channel will be back soon with new programs

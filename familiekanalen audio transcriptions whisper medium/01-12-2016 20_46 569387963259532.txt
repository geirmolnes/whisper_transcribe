me
To their father, to their mother, to their home, their family
Let the children, let the children, let the children be set free
No way, no way, no way, no way we're gonna walk away, no way We do not have a host with us today, but
I think we will manage
So, Inge, what is the team we are going to present to viewers today?
Yes, today we will talk about the stress, the stress of children and the stress of the parents that the children are taken away from We will deal with what is called the post-traumatic stress syndrome Yes, but before we look closer to the science and our ideas about why do children have such a bad time and suffer so much in the protection of the CPS
I want to say something about the process It will not be time for the whole process but
I will say something about the starting point of these processes Not every case starts with an emergency decision But there have been some kind of investigation before and perhaps they also have done some decision about some kind of measures that the families have been through
At this stage, especially at the investigation stage, the control from the CPS are really strong and mostly these measures have been camouflaged as help but still, behind this help, this control function, they are always there
According
to the Norwegian CPS law, the investigation should be as gentle as possible but also that the CPS workers
, they are all allowed to talk with the children alone
Many parents experience that the children change their behaviour already from the first contact with the CPS workers and the children, some of them get unsure, they get tense and stressed After a while, some of them react and start acting out Parents also change this and get symptoms of stress and
anxiety alarm or fear that something is
wrong
If they had some kind of psychological pressures or problems before the investigation from the CPS
they often get a lot more of these symptoms by the help they are giving
The investigation period, Karen Killen's methods and aims are standing strong We will now show a page from one of her books where she instructs the CPS deliberately to stress the families and make them frustrated
This teaching has developed a practice with methods to give stress and it has really gone wild Only limited by their own fantasy
There is no control with these methods, official control, because it's oral This is used in both the examination of the parents and the children and afterwards in these kind of measures After every contact with the CPS, they write down reports that the family do not read and are able to comment
This is how the CPS can make
a lot of documentation with only the CPS point of view When the case comes to the county board or court, the family have no chances to go against the accusations from the CPS since there is no evidence from this investigation that they can take their point of view They cannot show how the CPS have acted in their administrative practice The conclusions can therefore not be really tried afterwards in court
Now
I will set this way of tweeting clients against one decision The European Court of Human Rights.
It is named North Island against
Great Britain The methods
the British police had used in the examination of IOR prisoners were found to be
a breach of Article 3 in the Human Rights It was found inhumane and degrading
This decision is from 1978, but if it had been today, I would like to think that this had been
a decision where the methods were seen as torture The premises from the decision are that even if the methods not directly gave physical damage it still gave them a zero psychological and physical strain that also led to acute confusion or disorder stage of mind The European Court of Human Rights concluded that the methods were inhumane because they created anxiousness, fear and inferiority in those examined and in a way that was humiliating, degrading and suitable to break down their physical and psychological courage Stress is useful in many circumstances, but if it lasts for a long time, it's harmful Professor Mark Flynn has done a long study on how children
react to upbringing in different types of households Will you tell us something about that?
Yes, Professor Mark Flynn is in Missouri, United States.
He is a professor of anthropology
He has been studying children's stress in households in Santo Domingo over a long period
He has been studying 280 children over 20,000 samples have been taken and they have been analyzed
He has made a 90 pages article on this one.
The illustration we have here is taken from that
It shows that you have different levels of cortisol and you have zero which is the average in the middle and then you have five of the household types below the zero point and you have four above Some of them are well under, some of them are a lot over the average If we go from left to right, we first have the children brought up in nuclear
families which means that they had their biological father and mother and they were living with them We can see that that gives very low levels of stress
Then you have a few families where the father has been absent for up to 50% of the time and still you have the same result.
Still it is a stress less environment for the children But if you move on to the children living with a single mother, you will see that the stress is well above the average
Then if the single mother has her own
kin, her own relatives living in the house with them then the stress is down to almost the same as a nuclear family
So is the case where it is the grandmother and even better if it is also the grandfather around that gives stress on a very very low level
If you have a family with a stepfather, it is just a little bit over the average But if there are half siblings coming into the matter, then the stress is going straight up to a very high level And the same and even
worse would be the case where the children are living with distant relatives
So what this study
really shows us is that for a child to live with his or her own father and mother brothers and sisters, grandparents, that gives them a very low level of stress While those living with a single mother, those living with a stepfather and half siblings and those living with distant relatives, they have very high levels of stress And what happens to children that have these circumstances with the very high levels?
That is the question and we will come back to that But in his study from
Santo Domingo, there is
no children that have been taken away from their own families and sent out to strangers and that is the case in Norway today And that is really giving very very high and shocking results on stress
So we can move on from this study and see a little bit more on what is happening in Norway During a year, the Norwegian CPS will get around 53,000 reports of concern We have 60,000 birds per year in Norway, so 53,000 per year is a very very high number Those working in the CPS, they are stressing that you should be aware that there are more than one report of concern on those kids in danger as they call it But even so, we have a number of reports that equals 85% of children born, that is extremely high And the government of Norway has taken care
, as they call it, of more than 14,000 children
At the moment, they are taking 1500 new kids every year And they are increasing the number taken as babies or at a very very young age That means that 1500 per year out of 60,000 birds equals 2.5%
So 2.5% of the newborn babies in Norway can expect to be taken by the government
That is extremely high figures
In the official statistics of Norway, they claim that they only take 0.7% But that is way way back in time At the moment,
they are taking 2.5% which is more than the double of any other country
I know of The number of emergency decisions, which allegedly is the matter
only of life and health, that has exploded
It is now obviously regarded as the norm, not the exception it was meant to be
Acute decisions are characterized by deficient investigation, the absence of documentation and failing judgment And the authorities use that because
they can say that this is an acute situation We
need to move in now, so we do not have the time
to make
an investigation We do not have the time to get the documents And those judges that get these cases
, they say okay in a very very high number of these cases 92-93% And we even have some officials in Norway claiming with a public statement That it is better to take 9 children out of innocent homes rather
than to leave one child behind
This is just outrageous
So why have we seen such a huge increase in the number of emergency orders and protective care?
It is given clear guidance from the authorities like in Norway, the Bofdir and the psychologists They are talking about development, promotional affiliation as a new and guiding principle When determining what is in the best interest of a child The Norwegian Psychological Association has applauded Thus giving the support to the proposals from what in Norway is called the Reundalen Committee In an investigation in 2012 called Better Protection of Child Development
There has never been given
political acceptance to these
new principles But
even so
, they are now obviously guiding the practice by the CPS And it demonstrates the views and the ideology of psychologists, judges and the CPS workers But if it is the promotion of development that is the point, why are the results so dramatically poor?
And what is the fate of the parents of these children dramatically and abruptly removed from their family?
From their parents, their siblings and their home?
The answer is short, it's clear and it's shocking It's very bad Child welfare children have problems with schooling
They are struggling with mental illnesses to a far greater extent than their peers 51% of the children in foster care and 75% of the children in institutional care have
received mental disorders
Statistics tell us that there are eightfold increase in the risk of suicide among these children And
only
8% of them will receive higher education compared to the 40% in the general Norwegian population
So only a fifth will have the same level of education as the others as they had been
given if they had not been taken away
So the parents who lose their children through death, they are struggling heavily But they will have helping systems The parents who lose their children through a government decision or a court decision Will in addition to the loss also have to deal with shame
Being
branded as useless and the CPS trying deliberately to marginalize and to isolate them
They are also injured by the public confidentiality Where the public will publish stereotypes and stories about parents who abuse their children And who beat their children and who are heavily intoxicated and unable to care for their own children
They are constantly trying to use individual tragedies
to generalize There have been incidents of abuse known in the newspapers
There have been incidents of murder of children and they are used to generalize Of course
a murder or an assault cannot be used to take children away from parents who have never exercised violence And never have abused them in any way Professional secrecy prevents parents from defending
themselves And
representatives of the government throws out their general
statements
But will refuse to give any comment when question is raised on individual
cases
So they are making a stereotype and then they are not willing to discuss all the other cases We know that there is less
than half a percent of the children
taken which is on the use of sexual abuse
There are just 3 percent on the reason of violence against the children A little bit more is about violence between the parents which the authorities think is very bad for the children to see But still if we add up all of this we will only have 14 percent of the 14,000 cases, 14 percent of the 1500 children taken away every year All the others, the vast majority of cases are built on just assumptions about inferior
eye contact Parents run into uncertainty, there are allegiances of parents' ability to feed their children
They have, so the CPS say, bad ADL skills We have heard of children
taken away because their mothers are cutting too thick
slices or too thin slices We have heard of children taken away because their fathers smell sweat
Parents with different cultural background who are not sufficiently, have sufficient humility towards
Norwegian Excellency They come to Norway and
they claim that their own culture is on the same level
as the Norwegian one And this is by the CPS often regarded as an insult and they take their children
So from all of this we know that a lot of children are taken
away because the CPS claim that their parents are simple or
retarded Or their parents have different values and
different background
from
what the CPS uploads
So this is a result of intolerance and incompetence And we find increasingly that it is produced false reports and false allegations in these
cases
So why?
Why is it so important to destroy families?
We will have to look into some of the more factors and some of the research results We have what is called PTSD, which is a severe anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to an event that leads to a psychological trauma
It can develop after a threat of death to
themselves or others or as a result of violation against their own or others physical or physiological
, psychological integrity An infringement which is perceived as overwhelming in relation to the individual's ability to cope
So this PTSD is diagnosed as an original trauma which gives flashbacks in the kind of nightmares It is in avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and it gives increased levels
of tension Such as problems with their sleep, anger, nervousness The diagnostic criteria require that
these systems will last for more
than a month And that they cause significant impairment in social, occupational and other important areas of functioning Well, to be honest, it's hard not to find this Both the children removed from their parents and the parents who are deprived of their children will naturally get tremendous feeling of powerlessness They are traumatized and there is even an every reason to assert that many of them get PTSD And then we could move on to a study in the United States They have studied families and children in foster care And they have compared that to the statistics
they have on soldiers, soldiers from the Vietnam War and soldiers in the United
States from other wars, later wars And what they have found in a published study is that these children taken away from their parents, they have the double level of those exposed to war
So we know that to take away a child from its family as Professor Mark Flynn has shown, it gives a much higher level of stress Over a long time his cortisol study has also been done in Oslo Showing the same result that to move in and take away a child as a shock means that this child will have a very much higher level of cortisol over a long, long time And that means that they will have a PTSD in a high number of cases And that means that they will have bad sleep, they will have nightmares and this will come on and come on And as the study in the United States shows, this is extremely dangerous for a child
So they have, it is twice as
dangerous to be taken away from your
family as to be in war according
to the study There is also another important thing in the same study that the ability, the chance of getting rid of the PTSD is only half among those children
Only 28% of them were later getting rid of the PTSD compared to the soldiers where 44% of them were able to get rid of it
So for a
society to move in and take away children from their parents, it means that they are stressing the parents In Norway, we can expect that the parents of these children have 10 times the suicide rate as of other parents in Norway Very much of that is due to distress We have not been given the opportunity to study this in detail, but this is what we see And this is what we are learning from other countries' studies
So to move around, use the system in Norway is producing big problems for the children
As I said a few moments ago, that there are 8 times higher suicide rates among these children
Only 8% of them, one fifth of the normal, will get higher
education 51% of the children in foster care will have psychological disorder And 75% of those in institutions Compared to the rest of the Norwegian population, this is extreme Compared to other countries, it's extreme And in this situation and with this knowledge, the Norwegian authorities are raising the number of children taken
away It's very hard to find a good reason
for this We can see that it's a lot of money involved We can see that psychologists are doing a lot of good money as long as they agree with the CPS
If
they don't agree with the CPS, they will not have
a job
next year We also see that there is a lot of lawyers who are doing a lot of money from this
So they would like the system to go on And we also see that foster parents are making
a good lot of money
So a child taken before the age of one will give all these persons
approximately
$
2 million Until this child is 18 years old So I'm afraid that we will have to say that it seems that money is the reason for increasing the number of children taken Would we move on to the conclusion?
Yes When we have heard
Mitt Hansen talk about science, I would like to compare it with the limits of this European Court of Human Rights decision
It is my point of view that the CPS deliberately use methods to stress parents and children In that children have to live under conditions many years with distress level
I would think it is a method, I would say, oh, I'm sorry, it's been so long since we used English
I think it would be a breach of all three when we compare it with this decision They concluded that examination methods were a breach
But I would want to see this as a really psychological torture
I cannot understand why this theory from Carol Kaelhom should be used in this practice with stressed persons and families only to snatch a child It should be allowed.
They use so many methods in their work that no one can control Because it's our fault and you can't see them, you can only tell about it, but the court does not take it as evidence Because parents will not think it's truthful
, so they have to give the
CPS right They think
it's
right because they can deliver so many documents, which is very stance that parents react this and this and this
So they have problems, but they have already stressed them,
so they react in kind of rich way
So these methods, you cannot imagine how they use it and how it's developed Because it's developing for each case, they do different things, they do not think about the law, they do not think about the human rights
They just think to get a child and get an administrative decision for this child Yes, they would like to win the case
So what can we do about it?
We can tell the world and we have.
There have been huge demonstrations We know that Europe is aware of it now.
There are nine cases now coming up for the European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg
They are also by the European Council have started investigation into the CPS cases of Norway So we hope.
There are also coming new proposal to a new law The problem is that the laws are not followed, but we will try to give information to the world And by the help of the world, we will probably be
able to make the CPS stop
These illegal practices of Norway will have to stop
I do not think that a new law or anything will stop this practice because there have been so many new laws from the government And
they put into practice now But we will have to stress this, tell all the world to be aware of this, what's happening To see if we cannot make it stop We will have to believe that.
We will have to try very hard
because it is a disgrace to Norway Yes, but it still has to stop And you cannot have these CPS workers do whatever they want as long as they are not caught
Is there some way we can catch this?
Yes, we are trying to go to the police and tell them, show them, give them any evidence Doesn't work No, probably not

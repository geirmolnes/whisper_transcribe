 
Let the children, let the children, let the children be happy.
Let the children, let the children.
Hei, hjemme sammen.
Velkommen til For Mye kanalen.
I dag skal vi ta opp nok et interessant tema.
Se setter over til studio.
Hello, this is Rune Fadal.
I stay here in Oslo.
Drammasveien 60.
I forhold til forvandlinger for barnet i dette området.
Her er folk som er responsable for noen av de største fordelingene i Norge.
I dag snakker jeg om Dubai-kass, hvor parents er fra Finland og Sverige, men har levd mange år i Norge.
Det er en familie med to barn, to gjerner.
En er i dag 19 år, den andre er 11 år.
De eldre lever her i Oslo.
Resten av familien hadde å forvandle Dubai, fordi folk som arbeider i Barneverne, i dette bygning i Oslo.
Dette er en skjel som begynte, som så mange andre skjeler, med mobbning på skolen, mot den eldre skolen.
Skolen sendte en forvandlingsmessage til Barneverne, og da er den ekskalert.
I stedet for å ta ansvar for å stoppe mobbningen, skolen forvandlede parentene.
Folk som arbeider i dette, skolearbeidere i Barneverne og sin bos, hadde falske fordelinger av fordelingen, som ble platt i eldre skolen.
På denne grunnen, skolen ekskalerte.
Fokuset gikk fra skolens forvandlingsmessage til å stoppe mobbning, til en unik familie.
Vi har sett dette patternen før.
Skolen forvandlede parentene for mobbning, i skolen, og forvandlingen av Barneverne.
I dette Dubai-kasset, var fatheren fordelt å forvandle resten av familien, av folk som arbeider i dette bygning.
Den vanligste daren ble tatt av Barneverne og forvandlet, for å fortelle om fordelingen fra faren.
I dag hadde hun avmeldt at dette aldri skjønt.
Hun sier at folk i dette huset, platt falsk fordeling i hennes mind, gjennom intensivt forvandling.
Klassisk utsatt, skolen ble skjønt fra alle andre folk.
Folk som arbeider i dette Barneverne, vet ikke om dette, og har satt familien på Interpols liste av forvandlede folk, fordi de forskapte terroren fra disse folk, i Barneverne, her i Oslo.
Måtene, faren og den gøyeste dødren, er nå sikre i Dubai.
Men takk til folk i dette Barneverne, i dette bygning, og ledere Katja Violari, og fordelingar Katrine Andreassen og Pia Teie, de kan ikke komme tilbake til Norge.
Fordelingene er baseret på falske fordelinger, fordelinger og fordeling.
Folk har satt at de arbeider i dette Barneverne.
Problem?
Jeg gjør litt opptak.
Du er midt i opptaket.
Hvorfor tar du opptak her?
For vi skal ha det på en TV-stasjon, og for bydelsadministrasjonen ligger bak meg.
Som jeg setter.
Det er greit, jeg bare lurer på.
Ikke noe skummelt.
Jeg bare lurer på.
Sikker vi å være med på kamera, så bare holde utenfor.
Jeg skal gå ut.
Gøy.
Det var en fordelingarsgjort fra bygningen her, som spør hva vi gjør her.
Vi gjør hva vi gjør.
Dette fordeling er basert på falske fordelinger, fordelinger og fordelinger.
Folk har satt at de arbeider i dette Barneverne, har lagt i kort og gitt falsk testimone.
Det var ingen fordeling til å ta de børnene i første sted.
Andre dokumenter fra regjeringen viser at disse børnene var perfekt tilberedt til å ta i kjærede av sine egne børn.
Så det er de som arbeider her i dette bygningen, som er skjønnen til dette familienes hårdeste.
Familien er utvist til terror fra disse folk.
Og disse folk i dette Barneverne har kun visitert familien en gang i en time.
Det er alt det tok for Katja Violari, som er bossen i dette barnverk, Katrine Andreassen og Pia Teier til å forberede en lykkelig familie.
Familien er kun basert på historier som ble kreert.
I talene mellom de gamle søsterne, Barneverne psykologi Magne Olav Gudmesta og de her steder.
Barneverne psykologi
Tisthammer testifiserte i Fylkesnemla, Kante Bård, i januar
2017.
Han sa, Den største svartigheten med, og så navnet av åretens død, er at det er noen historier som er kreert sammen med henne.
At hun ikke gjør det korrekt.
Hun løser i en måte hennes egen stemme og hennes egen influens på beskrivelsen.
Dette er veldig forståelig.
Det som er sagt er ikke sant.
I barneverne dokumentet 87 fra 21. november 2016, er det skrevet om den gamle søsteren.
Hun ble akut stående for to og en halv måned i en barneverneinstitusjon, og forståelig gått til en barneverne psykolog.
Magne Olav Gudmesta fra dokumentene vi kan løse.
Den gamle begynner beskrivelsen med å si at hun nå begynner å huske ting som har skjedd når hun levde hjemme og at noen av tingene faller under overgrep-abuse.
Da folk som arbeider her og deres psykologer Gudmesta siden husker ting i tid og sted som ikke kunne ha skjedd.
Ressurser på husket er helt klare.
Husehuset er falske.
De er gjørt.
Det er objektivt å forstå at historien ikke kunne ha skjedd.
Dette kjærene ble aldri i stedene hvor historien ble skjedd.
Den gamle kjærene har nå tatt tilbake alle allegasjoner mot faren.
Hun trodde at alle allegasjonene var siste.
Hun er nå exposeret framtiden i et lett hun skrev.
De folk i dette barnevernet har platt falske husker.
I denne kjæren for å bremse familien.
For de folk her, vinn er mer viktig enn den beste interessen på barnet.
Hun skrev i en annen lett at hun ikke vet meningen av ordet overgrep-abuse.
Det jobbet i dette barnevernet brukte da de forstod henne.
Hun er den gammelst aviske fra Finland.
Hun skrev i en lett at overgrep er et ord hun lærer fra barnevernet.
Hun har vært spilt av dem å bruke dette ordet.
De ansvarlige folk i dette bygget platt de her husker i hennes mind.
Nå at hun vet meningen om ordet overgrep-abuse er forstått fra alle hennes høyre.
Hun har skrevet en lett til hennes kjøring og henne med hennes kjøring til barnevernet.
De beklager at de må korrekte det i dekommenden.
De folk som arbeider her vet ikke i all.
Det er veldig sikkert at psykologen som arbeider for barnevernet har skrevet forståelig forståelse.
Barnevernens psykologer har vært tratt henne for noe hun ikke har.
Det er maletreatment.
Det er også dokumentert at forståelene er forståelige.
Tid som skjønner med mamma og hennes ex-husbande har vært sagt å skjønne med den gammelste dødderen og hennes husbande i dag.
Da familien skjønner med gammelste dødderen til Dubai, var gammelste dødderen fortalt av disse folk i dette bygninget at gammelste dødderen... Hei.
Problem?
Ja.
Jeg filmer her.
Ja, det er helt greit.
Jeg filmer også meg selv.
Og du jobber hvilken er tatt?
Jeg jobber i bydelen.
Det er ikke greit.
Er det ikke greit å stå ute i en offentlig plass?
Det er ikke greit.
Det er ikke som man...
Nei, du kan bare fortsette å filme.
Jeg tror du kommer med noen andre også.
Ja, flott hvis de filmer.
Jeg vil ha familien skjønne med gammelste dødderen til Dubai.
Det var gammelste dødderen fortalt av disse folk i dette bygninget at gammelste dødderen var død.
Men jeg kan sikre deg at jeg møter en veldig livlig 11-årig gammel på en nye besøk til familien i Dubai.
De som er i dette barnevandet har fortalt gammelste dødderen at mamma, ex-husband, har hittet henne.
Det er en gammel dødder fem ganger en dag gjennom sine fem første år.
Men dokumentene viser at mamma har hatt hennes ex-husband når gammelste dødder var 8 måneder gammel.
Det er derfor godt dokumentert at barnvarnet her, som de menneskene har noen av, som vi har sett, har gjort i mange andre tilfeller.
Dødderen i Fylkesnemmet, Kvartalet og Tingretten, City Court, har laget i deisigen.
For eksempel, dødder Line Lunde i Fylkesnemmet skriver at familien har sagt ting de ikke har sagt.
Rekordninger fra Kvartalet prøver det.
Kvartalet gjør en narrativ som søker på barnvarnets falske historie.
Dødderen i City Court i Tingretten skriver at familien var i samme bil som sin gammel dødder da hun spiste til Tingretten.
De var ikke.
Tid og sted er blandet.
Ingen av det familien har vist og familienes psykologi, Tisthama, i Kanti-Bordet er i besøk.
Det er en bæsende beslutning.
Kvartalet oppstår selektivt hva som er godt for barnvarnet, ikke for familien og barnene.
Og sikkert ikke sikkert.
Dette er en fri fordrag.
Ingen positivt forståel fra den gamle dødenen er skrevet i Kanti-Bordet.
Den gamle dødenen sa bare til Line Lunde om mamen.
Hun er en veldig god mam.
Hun er veldig kjære og veldig interessert i alt som er i forhold til gamle dødenes liv.
Hun har ikke opptatt noen forskning på hvordan mamen treated henne og sin lille søster.
Det var exakt det samme.
Jeg kan testere at etter at familien møter i Dubai så er disse parentene gode parentene.
Norge har uansett artikel 8 av denne humanllekompetens av å banne familien til å møte fra Norge før Kanti-Bordet hadde gjort en beslutning og fordi av dette har de hatt en interpolist av åttet mennesker.
Barnemarnet har illegalt utkommuniseret passagerene av barnene og mamen uansett noen uansettleg rett.
Bare polisen kan utdrage passager.
Passagerene av mamen ble utsett av finneske autoriteter.
Det gamle dødenet har skrevet til hennes mamen at Barnemarnet vil avslutte den gammelste dødenen i januar 2018.
Men familien har ikke hørt noe om dette fra Barnemarnet.
I stedet stopper den gamle dødenen fra å besøke familien i Dubai.
Det sølte at det var en endring for hennes liv å komme til Dubai.
Det er et forvissel til at familien vil at familien skal blande seg og er beredt at segertene om fraudet av dem kommer ut hvis gamle dødenen starter å snakke.
Det var ikke nok.
Det er de samme folk i denne strålene Barnemarn som er bak den kjøleskjølen av Sylvie Garmu som forstod til Polen og som i recenten har fått asylum der fra norsk regn.
Faktisk har hun fått asylum fra jobbende her.
Så det er ingen bedømmer at de som arbeider her i Frongne Barnemarn er ansvarlige for destrukturen og traumatiseringen av flere familier og barn.
Barnemarnet er sikkert abstruktivt av ikke å avslutte dette tilfellet og å rådige familien fra interpoliske og vantende folk.
Jeg har i recenten reist til Dubai og møtt med dette familiet.
Håp oss høyere til intervjuet med dette familiet.
Du kan gjøre opp din egen minst om dem.
Ja, da vil jeg velkommen deg til en ny episode på familien.
Min navn er Rune Fardal og jeg sitter her med Marius Recheros.
Vi er i det tida lokert i Dubai og vi har besøkt en familie som hadde å runne fra norsk barnetverksystem Barnemarnet.
Og Marius, vi har vært her et par dager.
Vi kjender dette familiet.
Vi har sett hvordan de... Christmas, hvordan de bor her.
Men de hadde å runne fra Norge.
Det landet som ser på det som en humanerlige eksperte som tråder rundt om verden og som forteller alle hvordan å gjøre humanerlige rett.
Men her sitter vi i Dubai med en familie som hadde å runne fra denne landet.
Det gi noen perspektiv på dette.
Selvfølgelig, ja.
Jeg har hatt en friluft til å møte med dette familiet et par ganger før.
Dette er min tredje gang til Dubai.
I september i dette år har jeg hatt en beskjed til Europell kod av humanerlige rett.
En gang i gang var Norge i ansikt med seriøse krimer mot humanitet.
Og du ser at familiene har å råd til å forstå hele verden for å forberede deres familievalg og forberede deres familier.
Det er selvfølgelig mye seriøse spørsmål om hvordan Norge har å gjøre med humanerlige rett.
Du er vel annerledes at Norge var nødvendigværende i Europell kod en gang i nærtet.
Norge hadde å møte i grønnskabet i oktober
2017.
Nå sitter vi i Dubai med en annen kast som vil gjøre SHR med en veldig seriøse spørsmål om hvordan Norge faktisk har å gjøre med Europell rett.
Rett senere ble Silke Almo i Polen fordi de norske barnkjølesystemet eller de som arbeider med deres rett.
Ja, hun ble gitt i asyl, særlig fordi Europelighetskommunistet forførte denne kassen og sa at Norge ikke respekterer humanerlige rett.
Det er det mest seriøse, at mange av Europelighetskommunistene sier det.
Vi sitter nå med en familie som fokuserer på samme barnvarene som Silke Almo fokuserer.
Det er et prov fra barnvaren.
Det prøver at disse barnkjølesystemet og disse lokale regnene i Norge har ingen kunst til å kompleke med de baserte standardene.
Selv om de mest fundamentelle valgene av humanerlige rett er å bli violeret, ser man ingen annen alternativ som å rådgå fra Norge.
Det er en paradis, fordi når man sitter i Norge og hører om personlige gulve regnene, så kommer humanerlige rett ikke på toppen av listet.
Man hører veldig slemte ting, og nå har vi stitt her for noen tider.
Du har vært her en tredje gang.
Jeg føler at når du går ut i staden, er folk fremme.
Og det er noe annet.
Jeg kjenner ikke dette stedet fra det jeg hører om stedet.
Det kan være noe som må bli fikkert her også, men jeg tror at Norge skal finne sin egen problem først.
Det er seriøse violasjoner av humanerlige rett i Norge.
Ja, og takket til internasjonale medier, er flere og flere lander bør være vare av at Norge vil violere humanerlige rett.
Det var i Tansoniet, og der kjente de bare å jobbe med barnevarnet.
Det er en verden som hele verden vet om.
Jeg tror at internasjonale medier vil hjelpe mye.
Hvis dette tilfellet, som også er en pilot-tallet, som har blitt brukt til Europaforskningen, vil også gi nødvendig medier til alle andre familier som har samme violasjon.
Jeg er veldig glad at dette familiet har brukt på dette tilfellet i en måte som sikkert vil bruke mange annet aspekter til ulike slags violasjoner.
For eksempel et diskriminert aspekt.
Dette familiet har sikkert vært diskriminert av de norske kvartene.
Det måte som Svarsprotektivssystemet har kvart passkortet uten noen legale kontroll.
Det er så mange ting som er sammenlagt i dette tilfellet som er veldig interessert for internasjonale kommuniteter.
Vi kan høre.
Vi sitter her med familien.
Det er to barn og to kjører i dette familiet her i Dubai.
To barn og en barnet som er over 18 år har fortsatt i Norge.
Men vi kan høre litt fra din opplevelse med norsk regering.
Hvordan begynte dette et par år siden?
Hvornår kom barnet og hvordan...
Hvordan kom du først til denne tilfelletssystemet?
Det allerede begynte med falske oppdelinger som var direktet mot oss.
Det kom som en helt forstyr.
Vi ble helt forstyrs på hvordan det kom ut av blod fra klassen som vennet i vår tidligere dødskule hvor hun gikk i Oslo som var kallet Oslo Privatgymnasium.
Vi hadde bare nødt til Oslo fordi vår tidligere død var en stor sted i Oslo Privatgymnasium.
Vi trodde at dette var en veldig god skole.
Vi hadde vært i en annen sted i Norge for 10 år.
Vi har hatt hele vennet til å bringe henne til Oslo og forstyrs skolen henne.
Vi trodde at det var flere oppdelinger i en stor stad.
Da vi begynte til stor stad var vi alle blå i øyne.
Vi hadde vært i en veldig små utdelingesplans i Norge for 10 år.
Da vi begynte til Oslo kom vi til en skjort fordi det var en helt annen område.
Særlig for vår äldre død som begynte i dette veldig viss side i Oslo Privatgymnasium skole.
Viss side betyr at det var mange emigranser i skolen.
Alle var fra viss side, ikke fra east side hvor det var mange emigranser.
Vi trodde at det var godt for vår død som har en annen etniske fordi vi er en blandet, muligkulturfamilie.
Som mor har jeg vært i samme sted.
Jeg har vært brunner som muligkulturfamilie og jeg har velst å ha den samme.
Hun skulle brunne ut med denne måten.
Hun var den eneste emigranser i klassen.
Dette begynte å gi henne seriøse problemer i skolen hvor det var en snobbisk, større gruppe av barn som vet hverandre, de planer å starte skolen sammen.
Hun var som en nykommers.
Hun vet ingen, hun er ikke norsk, hun er ikke i gruppen, og hun begynte å face seriøse mobb, utstenging, utstenging som ikke er i gruppen.
Det ledde over tid en veldig, veldig stor problem i henne, som vi ville sørge ut til det kom til et sted hvor hun ikke ville gå til skolen.
Jeg vil gi eksempler på mobb.
Det er veldig seriøst.
Det er også fordi vi ikke hadde en sjukskapte med barnet, fordi de ikke ville ha noen tal med parentene.
De har ikke noen sjukskapte, og så gjør de ikke investigasjonen.
De gir ikke noen 5 minutter tal.
Hva er disse sjukskapte om?
Hva var dette forvandlingene?
Komte det fra skolen til barnet?
Ja, fra denne klassen.
Skolen sendte forvandling til barnet.
Skolen sendte forvandling til barnet.
Vist du det i forhold til barnet?
Hva var det om det?
Det var hele dokumentet som kom.
Vi løpte faktisk på det, fordi det var helt lika, som var lett å vise.
Even our ethnicity was a lie in it.
It was saying that relatives had visited us and had done some things to our daughter from Iran.
We have no relatives in Iran.
Nobody had visited us from Iran.
Who are relatives?
Nothing in it was correct.
This was actually what is my point, is that it was a girl asking to be seen.
She wasn't getting attention in her school, and when she started to get attention, and she got a lot, she created more and more of these things.
And then before you know it, it exploded in a way that one lie leads to another, and another, and another.
But the real reason for her being sad in the school was that
I want to really bring
this up, because this is very serious about the mobbing, is that it's not only the children who were not good with her, but it was the teachers as well.
So I want to bring a very important example.
The Sampons Park teacher in the Oslo Privat Gymnasium, she gave an example to the children in the school that if you were sitting in a bus, and there was a white person and a dark person, brown-skinned person, she was the terrorist.
She asked the children in the class, and the children said the dark person, we would assume, would be the terrorist.
Everybody agreed, and my daughter being the only dark-skinned person in the class found it extremely humiliating, and she really felt horrible about it.
And everyone in class looked at her at the same time when this was said.
She felt stigmatized.
Yes, these kinds of things were happening in the school.
So it was her reaction to this environment there that actually led to the worry from the class teacher to the childcare, barnevannet?
We told her that we needed to address this mobbing with the school, but she refused, because she was afraid that the children would be the most vulnerable in the school.
But she refused, because she had had racist problems in the previous place where we lived as well.
So she saw from that experience that it became worse for her in the school when she complained about the situation.
So she said she does not want her parents to complain to the school, because it would be worse for her when she's in school, because they start to treat her even worse.
And that is the time that
I went to speak to the helse sister of the OPG.
And I had a meeting with her.
Barnevannet was not in the picture at this time.
It was right before Barnevannet came in the picture that
I had already gone to the helse sister and talked to her about the mobbing in the school, about the drinking culture in the school, about the terrible things that the children are doing.
They were filling perfume bottles in the school with alcohol and the children were inviting to their home, if you don't bring alcohol with you, don't come to
my party.
So she couldn't go, because she doesn't drink.
And so many other stories.
This is just a nutshell.
And then
I went and explained all of this to the helse sister, who just, you know
, and I cried, I was so, like as a mother, feeling, I want to do something, I want to help.
And she said, we will take a meeting with the rector.
He cancelled three meetings.
One meeting he said he's invidualating a class, which is having an exam, he can't come.
Another time he said he's sick.
Another time I don't remember what it was.
The meeting never happened, it became summer, and the helse sister sent me a message saying that we can, you know, there's a bichim ring smelting complaint from
Pane
Vanet against us.
From a class teacher.
So the school sent a message to the childcare, the barnvare, that today the teacher was worried about your daughter.
Because it's the teacher who was not giving her attention in her class, when he noticed that she was never included in the group.
She was never in group work, she was alone, everybody was together.
He never did anything, and she told me all these things.
She sent me a message from school one day.
I have it as an SMS on my phone.
If I dug a hole in the ground now, this message came from school.
If I dug a hole in the ground, no one here would notice that
I have disappeared.
So she felt not seen by anybody.
So she made a situation where she got attention from the class teacher, then he started to give her a lot of attention, and they started to have secret calls and messages together for some time, with her telephone.
Secret meetings outside school, and then came the bichim ring smelting after that.
So the teacher met with your daughter outside school, after school time.
Correct.
And on one occasion, he met her for eight hours outside school, but we were told that she was visiting a friend for lunch.
She was going to go out to Grandland with a friend for lunch.
When it was, because I called my daughter after some hours, and she didn't pick the phone, so
I called up the friend who she was supposed to go with, and the friend said she is in Norge, in north of Norway.
That's when
I got afraid.
And she came back after eight hours to the home with the banevanet.
And this is, you see, part of the...
And I have spoken to people, and from what
I understand, it's illegal for a teacher to go with an underage child secretly without
a parent's knowledge, and have communication of this type.
I'm outraged about this.
And nobody has reacted in Norway about it, not the police, not the child authorities, that an underage child is meeting up with a man who has a child, a family, outside school without the parent's knowledge, who is not communicating with the parents about their child.
If there is something, we should all have sat together, right?
And talked about this, the teacher's responsibility.
Is that the setting that stays when the teacher reports this to childcare, and then the childcare comes in when the setting is like that?
What was your first meeting with the childcare there?
Did they call you into a meeting?
They called us to a meeting about these
lies which were complete.
Every sentence was a lie.
And
I sent corrections, by the way, when you sent corrections to Banevan, and those corrections never followed the case,
they never correct the documents, so they continued the case based on those lies which initially came in, and they are never corrected.
They don't listen to you, right?
They don't correct things either.
They say that you can correct something if there's not something correct, but you send a letter of corrections, but they never put it even forward with the rest of the case as it goes forward.
But what happened then?
You had a meeting with childcare, and tried to explain to them, did they start some investigation, or what did they do?
Because this is from the Banevan.
This is from the Banevan.
I met up, they did not meet up with my husband.
They met up with me
initially.
It was just
I explained everything to them.
I explained the issues and about her past.
I have been married before, so her biological father is not my current husband.
I explained and we talked and so on, but one thing after the other, one accusation after the other, led to the case where it is today.
Can we hear a little about what did the childcare in Norway do?
Did they talk to your daughter, or did they take her from your family?
What happened after you talked to the childcare?
When the Bishimring melding came, I had a normal talk with them about it, and everything was kind of ok.
But what happened was that my daughter did not want us to tell about the school mobbing, because she was threatening us at home.
If you talk about the mobbing, I won't go to school ever again.
She was afraid that if the school or the other students or teachers knew about this, it would be worse for her.
Worse for her, correct.
So what happened is that she did not go to school, because of the things that
I explained were happening in school.
At the same time, she did not want us to tell about the mobbing to the school.
So we were in a no-win situation at home, where we want to help, we cannot, because we respected her, that she did not want us to complain.
At the same time, we are seeing a child that is suffering, we are seeing
a school that is breaking laws, because they are not giving a good school environment to our child.
So she did not go to school, and that led to her having days off.
This led to me taking her to a doctor, who would write
a letter for her days off, because it was a strict system that if you have days off, you have to inform the school, right, with the documentation.
So when we went to the doctor, he had a talk with her alone, and she told him, I heard from her later, because she was alone with him in the room, she told me later when we came out that he was asking questions about sexual abuse and about very serious things.
A questionnaire which he had, a whole long questionnaire, with many things, mobbing, I do not remember what the questions were, but apparently she had
nodded to a question on it, which led to him sending
a bechimrin smelting also to Barnevan.
And she also informed him that she had a case with Barnevan going on, so he knew when she went there that there was a case going on with her, which made him to ask these other questions, because she naively just said to him that we have a Barnevan case going on. So the case actually escalated after meeting the doctor?
Escalated by him telling her that I'm coming here for days off from school, and then he made it into, he thought that, OK, I'll just also write another bechimrin smelting,
I have one already, and that kind of thing, because she told him.
And also before Barnevan came in, right before, not only had
I spoken to the head sister, but
I had also been to Sonan school, Kristallik gymnasium, and she had been to cathedral school with her best friend to try to change schools.
And her best friend changed the school because she hated the environment.
And when her best friend left, she had no one, no one.
So all of these factors, can you imagine, they just left her completely, you know?
So the problem with childcare actually started in school, and the environment in that school?
Exactly.
And then it escalated with the question from doctor, question from childcare.
If you can move a little on, what are the childcare actually doing in this situation, where you stay there, where the doctor send a worry to the childcare too, what happened there?
They removed the children.
From school or?
From home.
From home, so both of them?
Luckily our younger daughter was spending the night at her best friend's house, and the older daughter, we were reported to the police, the band reported our family to the police based on what the doctor wrote.
Just out of the blue, we were taken to the police station on a weekend, having a nice weekend at home, me and my
older daughter alone, we were at home watching
a TV.
My husband was at work as usual, he comes home very late at about 7 or 8 in the evening every day, and my younger daughter was at her friend's house overnighting.
The police, about six of them came to the house, all over the building, everywhere.
It was so scary, I mean
I can't tell you that image.
That was the police and childcare workers coming?
Only police.
Only police, ok.
About six of them, and they were banging on the door, they were knocking it down, they were like, it was horrible.
Came in, barged into our home, I was just lounging in my own home, watching TV in my privacy, and these
guys just
come in
like...
Did they say what they were after?
No, no. They asked where all the members of the family were, and that everybody has to come with them.
They didn't give any reason at all, they didn't say one single word.
Did you go with them to the police station?
Yes, we had no choice, they were like six big guys, and the way they come, you know, I mean in Norway you've seen the videos of...
They have uniforms?
These ones, they didn't have uniforms, no, but they were all over the place, and many cars as well, if I remember.
So you had to drive with the police cars to the police station?
Not regular police cars
, they were like, you know, this kind of... Civilians, sort of.
Anyway, you ended up in the police station.
We ended up in the police station where they separated me and my daughter, and she had
a temperature that day, I remember.
She was lying on the couch because of a high fever, which she had had a cold, and you know.
And I was so worried for her because of this situation, then they took her for questioning, and
I never saw her again till today.
I haven't seen my daughter.
So she was removed by the childcare system, taken into her sort of custody.
And these allegations which she was taken, and they interrogated her, she denied everything in that meeting with the police, that this is all a misunderstanding, this is wrong, it's not true.
They still didn't let her come home.
I want to go home, she said.
Two policemen, two policemen, big men, she was kicking them that I don't want to go with you.
She kicked them, it's in the documents.
I don't want to go with you, I want to go home to my family.
And two policemen physically forced her into the police car, it's written in the documents, and took her away.
And she was like 16 at that time.
It's illegal at her age to force a 16-year-old into a car against her will when she has no reason to go with them.
So she was removed to some foster family or institution?
Yes, to some institution, I believe.
Because that was the childcare standing
behind this removal?
Yes, the childcare made the police report and sent it forward.
It's all the childcare involved in it.
Can you say something about what kind of allegation?
Was this violence or sexual abuse?
Or didn't you give her food?
What was the allegation?
The allegation was that the doctor had asked my daughter a list of questions which is a regular if they are worried about something.
And they asked her a number of questions and one of them was sexual abuse.
Apparently it's written in the documents that she nodded, like she did her head like this, to put her head down.
And that was what made him to send the message, plus that she had told him that we already have a case with the Barnabannet.
So suddenly out of the blue?
The nodding of her head to his question.
She didn't even answer with a voice.
No, it's written that she nodded to his question and that has brought about all of this.
So the doctor's understanding of her actually escalated this even more.
Yes, and he sent it to Barnabannet and Barnabannet sent it to the police.
And here we are today in this...
After she was removed from the childcare by the police, what did the childcare do?
Did they come to talk to you about what they think happened?
Or what was the setting that went on from there?
The Barnabannet has never talked to us about the false accusations.
They have done nothing.
They have
only listened to what the child is saying they say.
But we don't know what the truth is because they haven't allowed any contact with our child.
They have allowed no telecommunication since she was
taken from the police station.
No telephone call, no meetings, nothing.
Two and a half years
I have had nothing with my child.
So from when she was taken, that was in 2016, until today, you actually have almost no contact with her?
No, until now recently she took contact with me herself when she got older.
And she was able to because they didn't allow her.
So they broke... When you talk to her now, she told you that she was broke from all contact with you?
No, it's written in the documents that we don't allow any contact.
We don't allow any contact with her and the parents.
Barnabannet don't allow.
But did she say where they put her these two years?
They have been moving her from
Borgavit to another place.
She tried to foster family, she didn't like it, she came back there.
She's been mainly in Borgavit.
And from what I've understood over the time, they have been, now that the case is coming out, they have been using words which she doesn't even understand.
The word overgrep, she doesn't understand what it is.
And Barnabannet is using this word and has told her, this is the word you have to use.
And now today as this case stands, she's saying that all this is the words that they have given me and they have said, I've shown you the document.
There is another document
as well which you should read, which is written by
my
older daughter.
It is their word,
I never knew what it meant.
And now that
I know what it means, I want that word removed from everywhere in the case.
So your oldest daughter told you that she was told what was the problem.
Yes, that this is the word that should be used.
Overgrep, that means abuse in English.
And the childcare told her that she was exposed to abuse.
And she herself today denies all of this.
And also the stories which have been coming, which she has been saying, I don't know where they are coming from,
which they are writing that are coming from her.
Because it's interesting as we have had no contact with her.
Because an example in the court, Budiltis Thamer, the psychologist in the court said that lies are being created between the older daughter and Barnivanet.
And she does not correct them.
This she said in the court, the psychologist
.
So all the stories which have been said that they are saying, my daughter is saying, it's interesting because
I have never ever seen this kind of thing in our home.
Nor have my husband.
This is not
from our home.
And then when she says this, the psychologist, that lies are being created by the staff and the older daughter and she doesn't correct, it means that they are falsifying the documents.
So what
I understand, the psychologist tells that
Barnivanet is forcing a sort of truth or, shall we say, changing
the memory of the child because they want that to be the story.
But there is no evidence of anything.
The police case is closed.
So there is no police case, there is no investigation, but the child care is going on. And we have no criminal record ever in anywhere in the world or for anything.
Nor has anyone seen anything or had any problem with us.
On the contrary, we have always helped everyone.
We have always been there for everyone.
We have had a very, very good relationship with everybody, neighbors and friends and teachers and children's friends and open house.
Just come in, go out, you know.
Doors open.
In that setting in 2016, when child care is removing your older daughter and probably talking to her a lot, what happened to you, your husband, and the younger daughter?
What are you doing at that moment?
Because at some time you find out we have to leave
Norway.
So they removed the older daughter and they took my husband into custody for one night.
They cleared him, let him come back home.
As he was leaving the police station, Barnivanet was standing at the police station.
Police said he can go.
They have nothing with him.
But they were going to continue investigating the case, which is today closed.
As he was leaving the police station, a person from
Barnivanet was standing there.
Outside.
A vakt, you know.
A vakt, Barnivanet vakt.
And told my husband, threatened my husband, saying to him, if you return home tonight from here, we will come back and take your younger daughter who is at home.
Because she had been overnighting, remember?
So they still left her because of this situation.
Yet that day that they hadn't come.
So he came home, packed a bag, and he never returned home.
He lived outside home till we left for Dubai in another address because they didn't allow him.
They said they threatened we will take.
Yet he went to work.
He was meeting other people and working and being allowed from the police to work.
But the Barnivanet is saying that we will remove your child if you go home.
If we can hear from your husband, how did you experience the setting that was happening there that some childcare worker sort of pushed you out of the house?
Well, it was a nightmare.
It was sort of a Kafkaesque.
I didn't see this coming
at all.
Completely shocking and obnoxious.
It was like a nightmare that you never woke up from.
Especially when they told me when
I went out there that if you go home now, we will consider taking your younger daughter as well.
That was really heartbreaking.
And then did you move to some hotel?
How long did you stay out before you found out to move from Norway?
I was not allowed to live in my home ever since they took our older daughter in September
2016.
I wasn't allowed to come home until we moved to Dubai.
How long time was that?
That was from
September 2016 till late January
2017.
So three, four months.
You had to stay out because of the No, more just about six months.
About six months.
But then at some time you find out this is intolerable.
And what was it that made you suddenly find out, ok, we move?
Was there something triggering?
Did you move?
No, I didn't move.
I didn't move.
I didn't move.
What was it that made you suddenly find out, ok, we move?
Was there something triggering?
Did they try
to take your younger daughter?
What was going on there?
Firstly, I'd just like to say that there's never been any reason for them to take our children.
Never.
That is clear.
And there is no reason for any of our children to have been taken out.
We love our children and we have given
them the best in their life.
The problem is not from our home at all.
I see a letter from your older daughter who's writing that all this is a lie.
All the accusations have been taken back. And Banevan is aware of it.
The police are aware of it.
It has been also sent to the Fylkesnemda and the court and so on. But you know, with Banevanet in Norway, they don't follow justice or laws.
They don't follow human rights.
They don't care about a person's integrity or persons to care about humans.
They treat you like you are rubbish.
If I can add, because now we know that the same caseworkers in
Frungner
Banevanet is also the same caseworkers in the Silge Garmo case.
Shocking.
But not surprising to me whatsoever.
Because
I have never met more incompetent, horrible persons in my life who are not concerned about the best interests of the child.
It's like they are concerned about some kind of harassing, using the power, enjoying to see people suffer, not liking that we were living in Frungner, which is a very upscale part of Oslo, and being an immigrant living in this area with a lot of rich
Norwegians and so on. It's come
like I feel a very racist way from the beginning, the way that they have been treating us.
Something underlying that you feel racist about.
For sure.
And no empathy whatsoever in any of the persons.
And I don't see anything that they have done that has been in the best interest of the child.
Because for example, Kathrine Andressen, who is the Sachsbehandler, in our case, she came for only one hour home visit to our house.
That's the only thing that has been done in the entire investigation by
Barne Vanet.
No other thing has been done.
So the only observation or actually the only time the childcare has seen you is one hour in all this story?
Yes, in our home one hour.
And they have written, Kathrine Andressen wrote a report about that visit of one hour, 49 days after she had been for the home visit, and she falsified the documents by writing complete lies about that visit.
Can you imagine?
And this has caused a case where we have had to flee from
Norway.
Because I see the way that your case is moving is very similar to Silkegaard, a case where nothing suddenly ends up in serious claims and police cancel everything, but the caseworker in the childcare keeps on going.
It looks like tunnel vision.
Yes, and I'd like to mention as well that in that visit in one hour, we were eating a lasagne which
I had prepared, and we were all having
a jolly good time, which I recorded by the way the entire home visit, because
I didn't trust them at all, since they removed my
older child this morning.
So I didn't anymore trust these people at all.
And during the time that we were eating, she wanted to have a talk with my younger daughter, because they want to start an investigation on her as well, obviously.
They never give up.
So she said very clearly, and
I have the recording, that my younger daughter would meet them at the Frogner-Barnivan station office, and mother can follow with.
Mama can follow your med, she said.
But did that happen?
No.
They landed up unexpectedly at her school, pulled her out of her class, and gave her a shock.
When
I picked her up, she was crying.
When they told you that they were going to meet with your daughter, was that in that one hour meeting that you had?
Yes.
So your daughter heard that too?
Yes, so she lied to my daughter, and my daughter was crying in school when
I picked her up.
She said that they came to the school, and mommy promised that
I could speak to them in the office, and
I told them that
I didn't want to, because she didn't want her friends and everyone to...
So this caseworker actually told you and your daughter that they
would have the meeting in their office, while they actually came to the school and took her out of the class, and stigmatized her again?
Yes, and they didn't do it once, they did it two or three times.
And then she... And that is school?
Yes, and then my daughter didn't want to go to school, and
I was having this problem at home.
She loves school, she's never been even off school.
She has a friend, she's such a happy-go-lucky child.
And a girl who loves school, she said herself, mommy, I used to love school, now
I hate school.
And they came again, and then again, unexpectedly.
The Barnivarnes work actually made your daughter have aversion to the school.
She connected school with something negative, and suddenly didn't want to go to school.
Well, she was afraid if they come again, and she kept feeling in the classroom, not comfortable, that when will the door open, and they pull her out again, and everybody's asking.
All her friends were asking, why are you being pulled out, who are you meeting, why do you have to go out, what's happening?
She was gone like an hour or so.
The child care is actually traumatizing her in school for no reason.
Correct.
Because they didn't have any...
Was there any worries about your younger daughter?
Any betymings?
There have never been any worries about my younger daughter anywhere.
Never.
So child care is just escalating the case, bringing in the younger daughter in the picture too.
Because it was their plan from the beginning that they
want to remove her.
That was their plan.
But she happened
not to be home when the police came.
But from the beginning, because when we had
a meeting that they had removed our older daughter, just that they informed that she won't be coming home, I said, oh, are you planning to also remove our younger daughter?
So Pia Taye, who was in the meeting, another case worker, said, not now.
And I told my husband, that is a scary answer.
She's saying not now.
Are they planning to remove her in some way?
You know that they're leading to this?
It's hanging in there.
No, we're not going to move her.
It comes as a very scary answer to me, not now.
She should have
either said
, let's see, or there's no plan, not now.
What does this mean?
Was that the time when you understood you can't live in Norway anymore?
No, no. We have never done anything to be afraid of.
Nothing.
We trusted
the system.
We said, look, let them investigate.
Let them do everything what they need to do.
If we had something to be afraid of, we would have left already that time.
I had the younger daughter home.
I could have left.
We never did.
But what happened was, this is very interesting, another breaking of human rights in Norway.
Scandal, shock, me being
a Finnish person.
I know my rights.
I'm
from
Finland.
My daughters both have
Finnish passports, and so do I. One day, my daughter's older daughter's case was running about her acute placering.
Maria Edakina, who is also the same woman who has been involved in Silja Garmos case, called me up on my phone and said, I want you to bring me and your daughter's passports immediately to Frognerbanavan station.
But they have no authority in taking any passports.
I was walking on the road near Soli Plus, I remember, passing
Frognerbanavan almost, picking my daughter from the school when she called.
I remember that day so well.
And I had a shock.
I said, I am on the way picking my daughter from school.
I cannot do that.
Sorry, can we talk again?
And I was saying that, but why?
She don't have a court order, she don't have a police order.
How can somebody
like
I know my rights?
She said, we want them immediately.
Just do it.
So I closed the phone, I called my lawyer.
I told my lawyer the story.
My lawyer told me immediately that you have to give your passports to the Banevanet.
Otherwise they will take your younger daughter for sure.
You have no choice.
So I picked my daughter up, and also, when you don't have anything to fear, you just do it.
But you then brought the passport to the child?
Yes, I brought it immediately.
And I said to her, if this makes you happy and makes you feel better while you are dealing with the case, please
take my passports, it's ok, no problem.
But
I could have actually technically left the country if
I had
something to fear, because I'm giving my passports, right?
So this is another proof that how they are doing with people, because this is restricting my freedom of movement and my children.
And after they got the passports in their hand, they really became nasty and evil, because then they knew that I'm crippled.
I have no more legs to run, I cannot do anything.
You can't get
away.
So then the game became even nasty and they treat
us even worse.
They never even took a call.
We tried to have a meeting with them and let's talk about these accusations.
We
want to tell you our side of the story.
Nothing, they never wanted to talk.
Were they interested
in listening to your side of the story?
Never, ever.
They never have listened to us.
They have promised to give us a meeting, but they never did.
They never did.
Sorry to interrupt you, but I'm very interested in that passport story, because obviously confiscating a passport is interference with your privacy life.
Exactly.
That can only
be done by so-called tribunals, and of course, Barnoran is not a tribunal.
So when you say that your lawyer at that time recommended you or more or less ordered you to turn in your passport, I am deeply shocked when he said so.
But I mean, what about your own intentions?
You said you know your rights, and obviously by surrendering your freedom of movement in a way that is obviously not legal for Barnemina to do.
I mean, what kind of reaction was that bringing to your mind?
The reaction that
I feel today is that if they had never taken my passport illegally,
I wouldn't be in this situation today.
Because they took the passports illegally, and then they take the custody of the child illegally as well, in a court system which is completely not functioning.
Did they go after your younger daughter?
Yes, they wanted to remove her custody permanently without doing an investigation and without any proof, without any talks with us, without anything.
They just feel in Norway that it's the easy way is just to remove the children and next case.
We don't take a chance, it's easy, we don't need
to do
an investigation, just remove the children.
How many times did you appear in Fylkesnemd, in court?
How many cases was that?
You obviously started in Fylkesnemd with your older daughter, and that went on to
Tlinget, or how did that follow up?
Yes, we went to Fylkesnemd with our older daughter, and then this Kathrine Andressen, the Saksbehandling in Frogner Barnivannet, who was in Silja Garmås case as well.
She landed up in my daughter's school, the younger daughter's school one day, while the investigation was going on after her one hour visit to our house.
She landed up one day surprisingly without any knowledge to anyone.
If I remember correctly, it was a Tuesday and my daughter was preparing for the school Christmas dance, which she was going to perform for the Christmas party, so she was a little later in school.
I came to the school and
I didn't find my daughter's jacket there, I didn't find my daughter's school bag.
Kathrine Andressen had
been there and taken her home, which
I later found out it was her, Kathrine Andressen, and took her acutely from the school.
Was there any warning report in front of that removal, or any bishimring smelling warning that she based that removal on, or did they just
come there and remove her from the school?
At the time when she removed the child, nobody knew anything.
We haven't received anything.
No, no, no. But they were doing the investigation from the one hour visit that they had been, which is the only thing they had done in the entire case.
But when they removed her then, how long did they keep her?
Because she obviously came back.
They took her to a secret location, they did not allow any contact between us and her either, like with the older daughter, for one month.
For one month?
For one month, in which time there was a task for Sean, a person who came to speak to my daughter, and many other things.
We went to Kyrkes Nemda court again, not court but city council again, and we won her back.
My daughter also was taken to the police for a very long interrogation, where she gave her side of the story.
We won her back home with the judge, Ellin Folkman, who is the leader of Kyrkes Nemda.
She wrote a very, very good report saying that this is a very good home for the child.
She doesn't see any reason for the child to be taken.
Was that the decision from the county board?
Yes, from
Ellin Folkman, the Kyrkes Nemda leader.
They didn't find anything to do with her?
No, and that this is a big misunderstanding with the religion, talk and about things which, you know, they were also of course being racist and talk about our religion and ethnicity and so many things which are brought in this case, which is a complete racism.
And then we ended up going again to Kyrkes Nemda because we want the child home.
And instead of coming to see the child after the child came home again, Banevan didn't come once to see her.
How is she doing after coming back home?
They didn't follow up?
No, even though they live five minutes walk from our house.
And then they were busy instead sending the case again to Kyrkes Nemda for permanent removal of the child.
Ok, so they escalated the case, not just tried to take her and then lose, but then start again to take permanent removal.
Yes, without even coming to check on the child after she's been returned home.
Like, where is the best interest of the child?
If you are so worried about the child, genuinely, don't you think that a caseworker is going to take a five minute walk from
Frogner Banevan to our house in
Frogner to check
on the child that you are so worried about that you want to remove permanently forever from the family?
Hello?
Ok, you come then, or they wanted to bring this into county board again.
Yes, and then when it went to county board again, Norwegian judicial system has so many flaws.
You have one judge who brought the child home and the next judge who say no. We take the removal forever.
So you lost, you win the first, and the next county board a month later or something, you lost something?
Completely opposite of the decision of the first one, without an investigation from Banevan in the middle.
At that time they wanted to take over custody of the youngest daughter.
Yes.
What happened then, after you get that decision, you appealed
to Tingret, the court system, and
lost the other daughter?
But I would like to mention that we were not in Norway when the decision came from the Fulkas Nemda.
Because we knew that they would take the custody.
We knew that we can't lose her again, because they are doing things which are so illegal.
Was that the time when you find out we have to move?
Yes, because we saw the way they are removing passports without following human rights, without following rights of citizens.
They are taking the child acutely from school, not following rights or human rights or any proper way to do things.
They are sending the case, they are not genuinely interested in best interest of the child.
When
I noticed this, that they don't really care about the child, this is a war between them and us, that they just want to win, they just want to take the children, they want to steal our child.
Then when we went to the Fulkas Nemda, we still thought together, we discussed, of course my husband was not living at home, because Banevan doesn't allow him to live at home, we discussed that let's see what kind of intuition we get from the judge, because the other judge allowed the child to
be home.
That there is always hope, like we must give this
a chance.
We cannot just, and we have our older daughter Norway and all, everything we
built is there, we live there and so
on. But you said that in the running up to the second county we were born, you were not in Norway.
In that time, did you get your passport back after the first county?
No, they never returned any of our passports.
How did you go to another country?
I just wanted to mention just shortly that when we came to the Fulkas Nemda, so we wanted to give a chance about, you know
, that maybe there is a chance that there will be again some justice, you know.
That we shouldn't live like this, you know, it's not the right thing to do.
And Norway is the only country in the world that we know where you have a law saying that you cannot leave the country when Banevan sends the complaint to Fulkas Nemda, then you are not allowed to leave the country.
This is like crazy.
So when we came there we realized that Judge was Lina Lunde, and she made, the entire case was based on racism and discrimination.
The way she interrogated us, the way she treated us, the questions she had were based on racism and discrimination.
We realized that she is trying, because there is no other proof or any
reason to remove a child, she is trying to make a reason to take the child, because Erlind Folkman, the other leader, had said that there is no reason to take the child, and the child came home.
So she was trying to make racism and our ethnicity and religion a reason to remove our child forever.
And that happened in the end, and this made us leave.
Did you sit in that county board?
Yes.
So you sit there on the...
I was quoted by Erlind, by Lina Lunde.
And then you feel that this is not going the right way.
Not feel, it was clearly direct.
All her questions were only based on where we come from, our ethnicity, our religion, things which had no relevance to the case whatsoever.
It's none of her business what my religion is, what my ethnicity is.
I could be coming from any country in the world, I'm
a human being.
She tried to make up something that she could base her decision.
I'm not happy that our child is not, according to Norwegian standards, written in the verdict, which we received in Dubai.
So luckily, good for us that we were able to make a correct decision to leave Norway without allowing our child to be kidnapped by Norway again.
Did you get your passport back sometime?
We never got our passports back.
I flew to Helsinki, and
I made a new passport.
And at that time, we are in 2016?
I took a chance, I didn't know.
Beginning of 2017.
I didn't know if I would make it.
I just want to correct you
a little bit, because when you say that the first county board leader, what was her name?
Erlind Falkmann.
She gave the custody, that is, you have to be a little bit more precise here, I think, because what she actually did was to say that the acute decision, or the emergency decision, there was no reason for that.
We had custody.
But in a way, she was allowing the other member of the board, Lina Lunde, to say that it was justified to take the permanent care worker, to take the child into foster home on a permanent basis.
So you have to distinguish between the emergency decision, which is to be, the board has, according to the law, the board has to make a decision upon that within a very short amount of time, after the bodyman has taken the emergency decision themselves.
So obviously these two members of the board, Lunde and Lundmark, could easily have been
discussing this case with regard
to the permanent decision.
So that's very important to be precise about that.
Yes, that's correct.
So you have to distinguish between the emergency and the permanent.
Yes, I'm sorry, because
I meant the acute decision, Erlind Falkmann, she allowed her to come back home after the acute placering, and Lina Lunde wanted to permanently remove...
So what the first board
leader is saying is that even though there was no basis for the emergency decision, there might be a reason for the next decision to allow the frontier baron to take custody of the child.
Anyway, at the last county board meeting you find out that this is not the place to stay.
No, we didn't receive...
You got new passports.
No, we didn't receive the decision.
No, but you get an intuition.
But we were sure that they were, because the way that they interrogated us in the court, they started with the Sachsbehandlingsfail by
Lina Lunde asking my
older daughter, who was also part of the case, because both the children were one case, she was talked to in another room
without allowing our lawyers even to be present.
And that is the Sachsbehandlingsfail, because it has to be...
And
then Lina Lunde, the judge, went into that room to talk to my older daughter.
Our lawyers were not allowed to be present, and these kind of things were doing, which were not fair court, fair proceedings going on. So we don't know what the truth is.
Is she making up something?
Or even our lawyers couldn't hear it.
So then when she interrogated us and talked about religion, and spent so many hours
talking about our ethnicity and religion, which we recorded the entire court proceeding, we knew that she is not caring about the best interest of the child.
She is on to something where she is trying to find a reason for herself to concoct and make up a reason what she thinks is justifiable for removing the child, but which actually is discriminating and racist and illegal.
And Lina Lunde also said that she asked me straight out there, what will you do if you get the custody of the younger daughter?
So I asked her, so what do you mean?
We have her at home.
What will you do if you get the custody?
Yeah, what will you do if you get...
Get back the custody.
Get the custody back of your younger daughter.
But you had the custody.
Yes, that's what
I said.
What do you mean?
She is home.
So she had already decided to take, you see?
Yes.
But we have seen in the papers
from
Lina Lunde's decision that she is clearly using discriminatory words, saying that it is important to take the child into public care because you are religious and ethnicity.
That is racism.
That is racism.
But did you have the feeling that she was, when you were in the board meeting, that she was making prejudice statements?
Was that a feeling you...
It was very obvious.
And it was so obvious that my husband's lawyer from Eldon, she also said, I have never seen anything like this court proceeding ever in my life.
And she said, I said, do you think we have any chance?
She said, I am sorry, I don't think so.
I am just honest, but I am sorry.
So all these things led to us really getting the feeling that it has not gone OK at all because this judge is...
And she also, everybody thought that the way we were treated was so bad in the way we were questioned, because this is not the way to treat human beings, ethnicity, religion, it has no relevance to the case whatsoever.
So we got a very clear feeling that there is no hope, no justice to be found in Norway at all.
So you actually, if you can try to round this up, we are passing an hour already, but your daughter had a mob problem in her school, the older daughter, and that led to the escalating all the time, the case was dropped by police, but the child care is still going on, and then they tried to bring your younger daughter into this, and at some point you find out we have to leave.
Correct.
And you got new passports from
Finland?
Yes.
What about your passports?
They had never taken my passport.
They weren't interested in my passport at all.
Ok.
But at some time there you decided we move.
Why did you move to
Dubai?
Why not?
I mean, why not Poland or Germany or any place?
Do you have some connection here?
I have lived in Dubai.
Dubai
I feel is my home, my second home.
My mother is
from
Finland, I was born and raised in Finland as well, but
I have lived in Dubai, I have had
a very successful business, I have lived here with an import-export company, my own company, successful company with a boutique, and I'm
a fashion designer, I used to design clothes for members of the royal family here, I have connections here from my
family ties and many things, so it's like a home, and some of the best years of my life
I have been spent here before my marriage, and I've always loved this place,
I have always never
ever had any kind of issues living in Dubai, I was single that time when
I lived here, and nothing, no problems whatsoever.
So you knew that living in Dubai was a good alternative?
It's the best alternative.
Dubai is a family-oriented country, and family is everything in Dubai, the values, the principles, the morals that people have here, the feelings of humanity and all of this love and being
as a society togetherness, coming forward together, doing the best for everyone, doing the right thing, having a conscience, having, you know, don't do the wrong thing, all of these things you will find in Dubai, you know, everything, graceful people, hospitable, loving, and
I cannot imagine a better place to bring up my children than Dubai, and I'm so blessed that we have this opportunity that we could come here.
This is my first time in Dubai, and what struck me when
I come to this city is that it is a very modern place.
It's organized, it's a lot of things to do for children.
It's a children's paradise, a family paradise.
You have people coming from all over the world, billions of travelers all the time, and everybody loves it here, and they want to stay, they want to come back.
Everything you can imagine is in Dubai.
First, we had a walk here the other day.
We looked around.
There are many things here.
Actually, my impression, when you stay in Norway, you hear about the countries in the Gulf area, you mostly hear something negative.
But when
I come here, I don't find that negativity.
I find big areas for children, parks, amusement parks, the place you live here is a quiet place.
You have restaurants.
You have everything you need, very close.
Nice climate.
Dubai is like everybody happy in Dubai.
We're
happy with the ruler, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed.
What a wonderful, beautiful heart.
He made Dubai with a vision, and
he made it with a vision for the people.
And everybody who is here, we are so blessed and thankful to Sheikh Mohammed, Sheikh Zayed, and all the rulers who have done this for the people, for us to enjoy, and they love the people, and the people love the rulers.
In Norway, the state, the authority, is on one side, and they want to destroy their citizens.
It's a complete opposite.
If you can make some comparison, have you been in contact, or
do they have a child care system here in Dubai?
Of course.
Have you been in contact with them?
No.
There is no reason for our family to be in contact.
But there is a child care authority.
Our daughter goes to school.
For instance, you have some people who have a little heart in the school.
If a child has something they want to talk, you know, something troubling you, they go to the person with the heart.
They can talk anything, they can tell what they, you know.
So, and if there is any reason for concern, the authorities step in immediately.
We have in Dubai, the police are fantastic.
You have really an amazing police system of integrity, let me tell you.
They have integrity.
So, I'm sorry, with all due respect to Norway, the police that
I have been dealing with in Norway, oh my goodness, I would never compare to Dubai.
Oh no. Because in Norway, your police are just following Barnevanet.
They are puppets for Barnevanet.
They are just, they don't care about doing the right thing, to have integrity.
Because to do, integrity is to do your job to do the right thing.
What has been allocated to you as a person to protect the civilians in every way.
And when you are breaking their rights and allowing them, their rights to be broken with the Barnevanet, what you are doing, you are the same as them.
Who can the civilians turn to then?
They have no trust.
If we can get, you live here now with your youngest daughter.
What is her timetable every day?
Does she go to school here and does she do something else?
Nowadays, as you see, you have met her.
She is having a great time.
Her friends just left from, they were visiting from Oslo, her old school friends.
They came the third time to Dubai and stayed with us.
And they wanted to spend Christmas with us.
They planned it a long time.
So they had a fantastic time.
They went to Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi.
The fastest rollercoaster in the whole world, which I cannot do.
Did you try it?
No, thank you.
And the, what is it called, the highest loop and all these things.
And not once, many, many, many times.
So they have had a fantastic Christmas.
So she is very integrated with her family, friends visiting.
And she goes to one of the best schools.
It's a British school, private school.
She wears a uniform, which she complains about sometimes because she has to tuck her shirt into her skirt.
So that's not so fun.
But...
They use uniform in school here.
Yes, they do.
And she has friends.
She is doing great in school.
She was studying in Norwegian, in Norway.
But her teacher is so happy about her progress.
Does she go to a national English school here in Dubai?
Yes, it's a British school.
British school, yes.
What does she do after school?
Does she have some activities?
She has friends all over the neighbors.
She has friends in school.
She goes for gymnastics to the Palm Islands, if you've seen on the internet.
We have the Palm Islands.
That's the big artificial island, just outside the coast.
She has gymnastics classes there.
And she loves gymnastics.
So she is regularly going there.
As you see, we have a swimming pool downstairs.
So she loves to swim.
And she has a dog, a Pomeranian, which you have met.
And she loves her dog.
She takes care of her dog, goes for walks, does lots of fun things.
And basically in Dubai you can do everything.
She goes to all the amusement parks, global village, goes to the beach, which is right next to our house, as you see.
And shopping centers.
I mean, just living a very happy, good life, having sunshine, and a nice view from our penthouse, which is just great.
When I look out the window here in the almost 40th floor, I am the top of the skyscrapers, sort of.
So
I have a question.
If the Norwegian authorities give you the custody back, the legal custody, of course, will it be an option for you to return to Norway?
We say it in the court, and we say it now.
We will never live in Norway again.
Thank you very much.
Never, ever again.
What Norway has done to us, who would want to live in Norway again?
I mean, you've got to be crazy to move back to that country.
I mean, I'm sorry, with all due respect, why on earth would we live in Norway, when there are so many other countries?
And you have to have changes in Norway to make people
want to stay also, because others are running too.
So I think that
Lindaheldenland and
all these authorities need to buckle up, because this facade which they are putting on, this hypocrisy, we can see through it, Mr Lindaheldenland, now.
We can see through your facade.
It's so transparent.
Because as you remember, BBC was in Norway, and they had to do with Run and Me as well.
And this documentary was viewed by millions of viewers around the world.
First, the Minister of the Ministry of the Interior did not want to comment upon the documentary, but later she did.
And then she said that they only remove children when it's absolutely necessary, and that we have the best system in the world.
She's lying.
Lindaheldenland, you are lying to the world.
Shame on you.
As a Baner Minister of Norway, you are depicting like a complete lie of your country.
And you are being held unsvarlig and responsible for your statement, Lindaheldenland, because that's a lie.
There was no reason whatsoever to take our children.
No reason whatsoever.
Because, you know, personally I've never been involved with Barnum, but I've of course worked for 10 years now with CPS cases, and brought a lot of them to the European Court.
And what strikes me, if you can confirm this theory, is that all the families I've met, either, I say to myself, either they have to be the best actors in the world, or actresses in the world, or there must be something truly
wrong with the Norwegian system, because all these families I've met,
I only take on cases where
I really feel to myself, this is something really outrageous going on with the system.
So
I have to say, either I have to be the most naive person in the world, believing in the stories, or the system must have gone totally wrong.
The only actor is Lindaheldenland and the system.
They are the ones acting to the whole world and lying through their teeth, and saying this is the best system in the world and best interest of the child.
Hello, I don't see even one thing that you have done in our case is the best interest of the child, or even according to international law.
But I can extend my question, because Heleland said that to the international
media after BBC was in Norway, but that statement was repeated by her lawyer, the government lawyer, Francis Saersed, when he was making his speech before the Grand Chamber of the European Court on 17 October 2018, when he said that
Norway
has the best system in the world and the international criticism is totally insane.
That's what he said to the court.
So what's your reaction to that?
Norway's Bonnival system is completely insane.
I would say that there is no justice whatsoever.
Normally you are innocent until proven guilty.
But in Norway when it comes to child care system, it's the absolutely opposite.
You have to prove that you are innocent, otherwise they take your children.
Do you know how many times Norway has been found guilty in the European Court of violating the presumption of innocence?
Four times.
Nothing has happened.
They just continue to violate the law.
I think either the child minister Heleland, either she is lying or she doesn't know
what's going on. She knows.
And if she doesn't know, then she shouldn't be the Bonnival minister.
Both are worse anyways.
Exactly.
But
I observe from your very eloquent storytelling to Mr. Fadal here that you were using words from the Barman Line saying that they have used false accusations or falsified the accusations.
And as you may be aware of, only
a few weeks ago a 72-year-old grandmother was convicted in a Norwegian court for using the same...
Shocking.
Does that frighten you a bit that your freedom of speech can be held accountable?
We have clear proof.
We have it recorded.
The grandmother said also that she had it.
Yes.
So the thing is that Norway is doing a Stalin or what you call Stasi methods of removing children and controlling their citizens.
The freedom of speech, removal of children, they are controlling their citizens.
And when
I compare Norway now to Dubai, Dubai has gone forward.
Norway is like a primitive country, I'm
sorry to say, compared to Dubai in my eyes.
Not only because of the buildings and the luxury that we have in Dubai, but in the thinking and the mentality.
They are going backwards in Norway, not forwards.
When you are going to be treating against the people and not allowing people freedom of speech, freedom of privacy of your life, of your family life and all of these things, you are a primitive country.
I think Martin Luther King put it well that it's always the right time to do the right thing.
You have to follow your conscience, you have to do what is right.
It's like a Stasi method of removing children and controlling.
Maybe your husband's word could sum it all up.
It's about time to do the right thing.
It's definitely about time.
When you see the public servants in Norway, it seems like what we witnessed in the court only a few weeks ago with that 72 year old grandmother, it seems to me that the public servants are willing to confront their own or to go to war against their own population.
Because it's a mafia system, everybody in the system is supporting each other.
The police, the justice system, they are all a mafia system supporting one another and each other's backs.
So whenever somebody does something, the police will back them.
Have you ever heard of a banivan person or a judge being sentenced to jail or to like the 74 year old grandmother even though they are doing more serious crimes?
No, because they have the backing of the system and until that doesn't change.
I see from your documents that you have tapings that actually prove that the childcare from the banivan has been lying and producing false documents against you in order to try to win.
The will to win is obviously stronger than the will to have human rights.
There is something seriously wrong with that.
And the arrogance with which they have met us, the arrogance, I'm so angry inside me that how can you treat people like this?
We are human beings.
Why don't you want to be empathetic?
Why don't you care about people?
Why don't you care about people's feelings?
There are parents who are committing suicide because of what the banivan is doing.
There are children that are taking in custody, who are having so bad, you know, but they don't care.
They care about that their money is coming to them.
They have the jobs.
The whole system is being funded and they keep their jobs.
They have foster parents making
a lot of money, everybody benefiting.
It's child trafficking in Norway.
You are stealing people's children.
I think we have covered a lot of topics here, but there is one thing
I would like to have some comments on and that is the legal system, especially the bargaining court of appeal or bargaining high court.
Because bargaining is the court in Norway that has been most times convicted in the European court.
If you look upon the statistics, bargaining is always there almost.
And as far
as
I know, bargaining court of appeal was also in your case.
So what was your impression with that particular court?
Let's hold to bargaining court of appeal.
We never met those guys.
They just, you know, didn't even take up our case.
No.
So what did they actually say in your case?
Because obviously since that court is...
Well,
they agreed with the rest of the, you know, everybody else.
They tried to make it like an independent scrutiny of the case.
It starts with the Fylkes Nemda and then that decision ends up in the Høyesderekt, in the Supreme Court.
Basically the Fylkes Nemda, that is where the trouble starts in Norway.
You should abolish Fylkes Nemda completely, in my opinion.
That's my freedom of speech, Norway.
I think you should abolish Fylkes Nemda because the trouble is starting.
It's not even
a court.
Most incompetent, evil, mean judges sitting there who have already decided 90% of the cases to remove all the children.
And that decision goes along all the way down the line and ends up, you know, maybe in ECHR if the parents have the strength left in them and if they're still alive to take it there.
Did you feel like Ipå Gatling had independent scrutiny of your case or just...
Did they just endorse the number of... No, they just didn't probably even read it.
They just probably threw it in a rubbish...
Next, we haven't had anything.
Just send it to the next...
Take no responsibility whatsoever.
Ok, but we are way over time here.
So I think we got the main picture here from this case.
We are now in Dubai because of the people working in the Norwegian childcare system, Barneveldet.
And these people are putting...
They are treating people at least not in accordance with the human rights law.
And it looks like it's just to win.
There is something in that system that needs children so the system can go
on. And it has been sort of a system for the system case.
So it strikes me when
I come to your family here in Dubai and sit here in your beautiful home, relaxed, no worries that police storming into the house or anything.
We have been out looking at the city, all the amusement park, school for children, she go gymnastics.
You have a normal life here with no worries while in Norway many hundreds of thousands of families are living in fear for somebody knocking on the door, police storming in in uniforms or whatever.
And that is a picture
I think you who see this program should think about.
The Norwegian government with in this case the Barne minister, Helle Land, the child minister, is preaching out a message to the world that the Norwegian childcare system is the best in the world.
But this case, Silke and Mokey's who just got asylum in
Poland running away from this best system in the world should make you all think.
Is the Norwegian government telling you the truth or is the people represented by this family telling you what's really going on?
Because at least in Norway they tell you Dubai and the other countries around here is bad business for everything, but when you come here, can
I move here?
You know, the Sheikh Mohammed and Dubai say everybody is welcome to Dubai.
Welcome Rune Fadda to Dubai.
But before we wind up, I would like you to know some members of the European Parliament as well as the European Council will obviously watch this video when you know that they have raised strong criticism against Norway.
So if you have some final words to the members of the European Parliament and the European Council,
I think this is the time to make like an appeal because they obviously see that something is very wrong in Norway as well.
I think the European Parliament should know that there are very, very strong, brave, courageous people, justice
fighters like Mr. Rune Fadda and Marius Reykeros, Stephen Bennett, Søra Naya Ivar, Bjørn Kof and Christian Post and so many
others I can name and thank from bottom of our hearts today for all the support that we have gotten from you all.
Without you, we wouldn't be able to address this injustice which is going on and breaking of human rights in Norway.
And I also want to take the opportunity to say that the reason why European Parliament does not hear more is because Norway, as you hear, is a stussy method of controlling their citizens, are also controlling the media.
And the media is not allowed in Norway to really bring out all these thousands of cases, not one or two, believe me.
There are thousands of them who don't have the capacity or the means to bring forward their things.
And not
only Banevan.
Look at what happened now, Tolkassaken.
Look at this.
Look at so many things.
This system and the way Norway is
treating their people is shameful.
And media, now when they uncover, then the state says, OK, we look into this and look into that.
But they really are a nasty state who are not caring about their own people and they need to start doing that.
And because of that, the European Parliament have not heard really what's happening on in Norway.
And they would hear much more.
You have BBC who comes from England to hear about it.
But Norway itself is quiet.
Hello.
You know, this is not the freedom of speech.
So the 74-year-old grandmother get charged for freedom of speech.
And media is scared also to come out because they don't want to go to jail for telling the truth.
So
I think I'm so impressed by the 74-year-old grandmother.
Really, really amazing lady.
I'm so proud of her.
OK.
We leave that as a last message for the European Parliament and for the Norwegian people in itself too.
And as the husband here said, maybe it's about time to rethink something in Norway.
So with that, I say goodbye for us here in Dubai.
I can recommend anybody who want to visit this part of the world that Dubai is a peaceful place and there is very nice to live here.
So with that, we say thank you and we will soon be back with another program.

 
Let the children, let the children, let the children be set free.
Let the children, let the children, let the children come to me.
Let the children, let the children, let the children be set free.
Let the children, let the children, let the children come to me.
To their father, to their mother, to their home, their family
Let the children, let the children, let the children be set free Welcome to a new episode of Family Channel
I have moved to Kristiansand, just north of Kristiansand It's called Glitter here, isn't it?
Glitter, yes We are visiting
Dom and Harald Who are probably known to most people We are going to have a demonstration here in Kristiansand tomorrow
That concerns their case But let's first take a short introduction Who is sitting here?
We start with Oddvar, I would say Yes
Then
I have revealed what your name is My name is Samuel, I am from Harald and Dom Yes My name is Anneli, I am from the Philippines
Alf Magne Henrichsen, from Stavanger And I am Rune Fardal Dom, from Vietnam Anneli, how old are you from Stavanger?
My name is Daniel, I am the son of my mom and dad from
Stavanger
I am Harald, and
I live with Dom, and then there is Samuel, and then Ariel and Gevlit Yes The two missing children
So you have two children that the children have taken
Yes Yes If we could start with that, how did the
problems start for you?
What happened first?
It happened that it was the children of Harald who reported us to the children's ward Anonymously, we did not know who it was, it was just anonymously Yes And then
I was pregnant with Samuel But once Samuel was born, the children's ward reported us and threatened to take him with us They said that we should take him with us, because of the concerns from the children's ward Yes At once Yes They did not investigate anything, they did not make any statements, they did not help anything
They did
not say anything, they said that because of the concerns they wanted to use paragraph 412 Yes
I have learned since then, I could not do anything, but because of that we are stuck, it is written there And then they came and took him first?
They came and investigated, they told us that they would meet us So we said okay, they would not have learned anything, they would never have taken him with them
No They would never have started Because you lived here that time?
Yes You lived here all the time, because here it is, what struck me when
I came here at once, it was here it is country-like And then it is 10-15 minutes down to Kristiansand
So there is plenty of space for children
A dream for children Yes, I remember when
I was little, we lived in the same place, we had
space to play, it was absolutely wonderful
I remember when it was nice to go to the country, where there was a farm Yes, you could climb trees there, now you have to have arm protection and everything to play Yes And when did they bring him to Kristianand?
No, they brought him to the farm Oh yes
So we stayed here, then Ariel came, the second son, and then the girls came here after him
So it was 2008, or actually in
2006
,
they wanted to send the children to us So we brought them to Vietnam in 2007, then we came back in 2008, after a few months here, the police came The police came here?
Yes How many were they?
I could not count how many there were, but the children told me there were 16 men at least 16 men from the police?
Yes Did they come in civilian clothes?
They came in both civilian and uniform, with weapons Those who came in uniform, they were armed Did they have helmets too?
Yes,
they had helmets and helmets, and machine guns, and machine guns, and they could not forget
They were very good What kind of concern message was it?
Was it Breivik clan?
Someone
must have blown up the situation Yes, it says that they got a message from the children that Harald was dangerous for our children And that was due to that concern message?
Yes, from the children Yes And the police too The police too?
Yes Our friend calls it the Breivik clan Yes They came with us And then they took us Yes, they took us first with Harald, down to the police station, and we were, at least, in the grass first Yes A few hours there
Yes They first came with us, I do not know if they did with Harald And then
I was put in the grass for a while before they heard me
After they had brought us, or brought most of us, I saw Harald and was finished, and then they drove
us home again
There
were children
in the sun
So they took the children in the meantime?
Yes, while they forced us to go into their car
While they were there,
they took the children Yes But you were in Vietnam, how long have you been home?
We have been home for a few months
Did they come for money?
Yes, they came for money
If they did not come Was it the same concern message that was there, or was it a new one?
Or were you just waiting for them to come back?
I felt that they were waiting for us to come back and take us Because we came here without telling anyone Unaccompanied And it was someone who had seen us, so
I reported to them And then they came, and we did not know that they were coming
So that is why they are here, the children are vulnerable We came here, we lived here, the children did not go to school at all They lived there against us So it is very important with school If it was because of school, we had
to move There is no school duty in Norway, but there is a teaching duty You have to teach at home Yes, we teach at home Yes, that is allowed Yes, but it is not allowed, is it the children's law?
I do not know, I can not promise And the children were beaten at school, the same teacher was beaten at school
So you got a message from school that they were subjected to violence there?
No, the children told me themselves And then a woman who worked there at
school told me
That they were bullied?
Yes, that they were
beaten She told me, she called me, she was shocked
She did
not see it, but her son saw it and ran home and told her My mother told me many times, it was very shocking for her But that was while
they lived here, or after they moved?
It was before we moved to
Vietnam While they were still at school After we had told the school that our children were beaten The school had also registered us to the children's ward Registered you?
Yes Because your children were beaten at school?
Yes And the children decided that they would take them through the court And then we decided that we would leave here Was there bullying at school before?
Yes Bullying and violence?
Yes, physically Yes, physically, it was just as mental as you could see
It was both mental and physical Did you have classmates then?
Yes, but not in the same class What was the reason for doing it?
Did they come from a different culture?
They were ugly, the students were ugly Yes, it was an anti-social environment
So the school does not take care of that
problem?
No, they blame the parents
They blame
the parents instead of the school
It is very common
They do not want to take care of it We see this in many places, especially when parents complain about how this is treated
The parents are responsible for it
The parents are responsible and the children's ward is connected And you can not take your children, but the cause is a completely different place The school is not able to take care of the students Yes, that's true The school is actually very dangerous in Norway After what they have experienced The worst thing that exists in Norway is the school The school system is completely terrible We see this in many other schools too
If the student has problems, it is always the home that is to blame
Not the school that is not able to
fix the situation
It can be other students
at school who make a mess And then you get involved and blame the parents
I think that is the reason why they do not have the rules They do what they want in public schools
It is quite crazy how many students per teacher
I remember when my parents met with
Mathias They showed us the classes they had
It was so crazy that we did not even have the time to look at it And we were replaced with private schools And then the school said that this is not right In schools, it is like a wave And they knew
why
they did it
So it is the public who is
to blame And they blame the parents And then they take the children into the public Who are not able to take care of the children
It is pretty badly done
It is terribly bad
It has failed professionally all the way You have talked a lot about the Perliland justice murder But there is a lot of justice murder happening here every day Yes, it does
It is not possible to have it like that anymore But the way you are treated
It is typical what you see in many cases The children's world is blowing up And the police are here and there And then the police are here and there And it looks very bad when they come to the police Oh, here the police had to do a search Oh, it is not good for the children to live here But there is nothing
It is a play It is not fact And you see these people who are taken away from the children in the nursery
Where
are the measures they should take?
And where is the faith in the parents?
Mom and dad have been in the nursery for 20 years
So what?
If the nursery is going to help the children, then the children are not better off
But
then they are labeled as totally disqualified It is not the children's best to come and pick up children from a nursery The parents should be allowed to try to be parents And then
I think they should be filled up Or get help
They do not do that
They do not do that But then you also have the children's law that as soon as the situation is good, the children are back As soon as possible
They do
not do
that
either
They sabotage the way If you are in a serious care, it is punishable But who is punished?
What is the punishable relationship?
Is it a percentage or a percentage?
And another thing, when this happens in the nursery
Then no one is punished Never Violence, self-harm, bullying, threats And then the parents talk
back Your parents are bad What do you do with a child?
No one is punished They are fed up with the information that they believe in it
They do not want to have long hours with their parents Because they believe that the nursery is right What they say is right But it is totally wrong
It is brainwashing We see it with our children who go to school
If they were before and they were taken
It is serious
It is so serious that the children who have been
taken
They can not have contact
with their parents After the friends they had
It destroys the security that the child must develop It is damaged
I have seen many where they get the child back And the child does not want to leave the parents Out of fear of losing them again That's what happened with Bonaire and Sacken That's why they moved to Romania Because the children were afraid They were afraid to leave Because they were taken today Or they could come home What does it do to the child's brain that grows?
It destroys it completely Here we have you and your oldest son Oldest You have understood that you live here You live here, you have everything
Why do not you send home some water for the children?
That would be a disadvantage for them Who can understand something like that?
They live in prison and no one checks if they are doing well Or if they have gotten it to home
It is the children's law The conditions say that That does not mean anything
The oldest brother and the witness have not been well You see the children running around
It is completely unfortunate for the child to grow up here But that is not quite true
Say there is a family of six
Two adults and four children
Two of them can live at home, two of them do not Where is the logic?
I do not understand that What does that do to the siblings?
Are not the parents happy with me since
I do not get to live at home?
Then they hear from the foster parents Is the mother and father your own family?
They are bad parents
They destroy and where is the security that the child should develop?
The system is terror
Terrorization It was terror
This is
for lifestyle That's right These children are 18
They are out Where do
I belong to then?
Mother and father are bad
They have heard all their lives that they are bad Where should
I go home?
It is not strange that there is a lot of...
Now it is proven with the research with
100,000 foster children
That
70% do not grow up After they are 18 In adult life And mortality 8 times greater
In foster children than those who live at home And then you blame the parents after they have lived there
18 years many times No, it's the parents who take the child to the foster home No, it's the parents' fault You understand that this is wrong in the argument
They conclude that we have to take the children
because something bad can happen in 5 years
Maybe in 5 years
I do not agree
It is a misjudgment
I look at the foster children when
I drive today It's like weeds What do you do when you have weeds? We sit in the parking lot here If there is a lot of weeds, it does not work In 10 years they will fix this weed And the children will have it all the way Everyone knows that weeds are fine But it has to be removed It's like a leaf that comes back
If you remove the flower, it will come back
If you do not remove the root Everything has to be removed And plant
some rose
bushes instead And so many children get to come home But it's nice to be gathered We
are few here today But we are not few No, there are many thousands out there We managed the same thing in Oslo Yes They have to give themselves
It did not come to the media But up north, there was a raid On a BVB officer
They did it here in Høvik too
The girl who was killed, she was an environmental
worker Yes, that's right
There was a grandfather Who was a
doctor and a child care worker
He shot her Who was to blame?
The provocateurs or the one who reacts to provocation?
If you do not take a crocodile The doctor will take it Yes, he does But it did not hurt them
Now they will take care of children And sit in the office with shotguns and locked doors That's taking care of children
That's how it will be
That's how the rich security
They are sitting in a bunker Yes That shows that they have
lost contact with people
You do not see the only BVB office When you come in there
Where the BVB office will be You do not see anyone No, absolutely no Then you have the guy with the whip The teacher book and the hands When you come to visit the parents Stress them as much as possible And see if
they can stand it
I can not see any comfort in themselves When they
talk to the four of them
That should
drive the people on
If they do not manage it What then when we would not have been
there But then we can turn this back Now we stress the child care employees How do they react?
They call the police, violence and threats And then they
lock themselves in
They behave just as they claim I'm
worried about others
should behave
So they go and they reveal themselves so easily We were active
in this fight for over ten years ago We have received messages from one person And not one message But over fifteen violent incidents That was a life fight And I was helpless at the time
Then he gets the feeling to see the system so good and so close
If you are on a meeting to talk to them And see what they can write And then you can get a message And then you ask if they have a new meeting And they say no, that is not possible But we can add a message That's it Because the shit must lie The madness
There must be something
They can not just throw it away Because it was wrong
They can add a message That the three sentences are not correct And not one child was told to open the door No, they keep it secret all the time And these investigators can do it Because they know that what they write does not come out
As often does not come out Because it is a game of dice
The courts protect them Because the courts depend on the investigators So they say, okay, undue vulnerability And they can earn 150,000 for each report several times a year And they can write a lot Because that's what they write Look at that one She was up in this What was her name?
Psychologist Villok It was up in the valley The case was up here a few years
ago Yes, it was A few years
ago?
Yes, both parents were imprisoned They had an assault for years The head of the children's ward knew about it What was the name?
So many thousands of cases It was a very big case
Then the prosecutor went out on Facebook And asked people on Facebook
I have a case like this
Do you have any
idea what I'm
going to do here?
Not true?
She was kicked out By the journalist, luckily But she was kept on the run for 100,000 But she was kicked out
She is not
particularly one of the six children
Because there is a lot of...
Many psychologists say that they become psychologists to find themselves That's
not true It's quite obvious
We have the police in the ward When you see...
Here they take five children on average
Per day
Around 1800 a year
In Poland they have about five
a year Yes But it shows...
Down there was Tallinn And here was the Fjord and the Forfjord And they have an idea of how the family stands there
Much stronger The Catholic Church
, for example The family is the core of the whole...
They dare to go
out on the street
They dare to ask for help And they dare to help each other
In Norway you see fewer and fewer children in the street
They are not out
to play anymore
They rather hide behind TV games and... But of course, if you get that impression when you live in Norway If you go and ask for help
There is a big chance that you will be lost You can't ask for help
So you learn to adapt to this madness In Norway it is a very open society People are encouraged Kindergarten teachers are encouraged The Parents are wrong They are not the ones who are in charge That is the truth
It is a terrible madness But...
Let's continue with the morning You are going to have a demonstration in Kristiansand Tell us a little about that Well...
It is Saturday
Over ten years
I have read books and put myself in books
The first
concerns
I have are with the effect
It felt like
I was going to die I was ready to breathe You get a shock Yes, I felt like
I was going to die But
I was young then
So
I am not afraid of heart attacks or anything like that But if this was the first time today I would have just passed out
I would have been sleeping Yes, she is a negative person The sick and the sick are lost And...
They were afraid that they could not take care of the other children in the grief process
So they apologized
They did not want to put
the stone to the grave Yes But that was the first message
After we were not alone as
parents Because we were in deep grief After we could not take care of the other children That we had before
It was not about helping you through the grief No, no, no, no, no, no, no There we have help
There was a full investigation at school
At home The psychiatric nurses came home and talked But they had
nothing to say
They did not talk
It was a normal grief process that
I went through And with two good words to the oldest who lived
at home And those who were at Sambær But here the music is good Because it will be fine You should have one of the 100
I would say today At the children's ward If you have some wood and can see a little
Then you should meet one of the 1000 of the lawyers
Then you will be happy And you should have a network There are so many fine things If one of them is sick
Then there is no dominoes
Then they are all sick
Then it all melts It is life-threatening But the demonstration Then we started searching the internet And found out that we were alone Others had also received concern messages But I have been a doctor for many years
I have never been free
I see it so bad
I wrote the appointment But
I will never give it to us Before the ward And then they are back again And
I stand for that But that is what the demonstration is about tomorrow Yes, for this family
Will it be
like Stan?
No, it will not be like Juslo We plan
a little here together The ward and the family We have not searched for a place We will see how it goes But the tourists will see The tourists will see it too So it will be nice for the municipality But
they deserve it
So the tourists will get
something to talk about
So we will do some English Hide your children Welcome to Norway When I was on my way down
I saw a lot of Danes, Russians, Swedes and Severans
A lot of tourists The word child protection is a Norwegian word
Used in the south of Norway More and more negatively
It is not even translated
It is almost like FAN
It has become a ban Romania goes so far
They were reminded when they were communists And they see that if you give What should we call it?
If you give someone so much power and freedom
So long, then it goes wrong
It becomes corruption and the worst It has become a state in the state Politicians do not dare to go in Experts do not dare to say anything
Because
they have so many divisions of power That you lose your job if you pull a little And then with a
lot of things
For example the demonstration in Oslo We were about 10 medallists One was from
Australia
If he did not get away from us And did everything he was supposed to do
Then he did not get up on the little one
They think and believe
That is what you have
to have up there too
I can not say it, but within the municipality
If
they do not give, then
they lose their job They do not dare to criticize
They should not be like that
Then you have those who dare to stand up Most do not go against the power You see Kelen now Now he has
retired When
I was at the Kim meeting in Oslo
Then she said right out Now
I do not need to apply for permission
So now I can say right out what
I mean That she said
If you should believe it Or if she is trying to improve her message
It is not good to say When you are going to apply for permission You must have the right attitude
Then you have to be politically correct
Then she must say what the kindergarten has said
Follow the stream But now she suddenly jumps over to the enemy Then you ask where she really believes Is not professional foundation what she has been doing?
Or can she suddenly say something else?
No one believes what they mean
There are many who wonder why she is in Kibber
She was probably seen in 1993 as a law The kindergarten law But
Kari Kelen is the architect And they have not done anything since
1993 Future per day status And then she should decorate a little at retirement No,
I do not buy that
I do not do that
She wants to make it a little comfortable for herself That you may not try that
Maybe the others in that group use her
a little
She is a kind of fit in the environment Yes, she is a factor in the system Even if she is good She is a father in the house No The crime must be exposed
It must
be exposed People must
be exposed That is the crime They should
be punished for breaking the law
They stand above the law
I do not think so
As long as they do that
Then we have no law here
It is lawless Yes, it is But that's what we're starting to see now Now we start to confront them with that
Take the municipal attorney in Bjørndal in Fjell Now we started to confront him with what he does And then it turns out that it is not just in the case of the kindergarten
It is other cases
He lies, he produces false statements And now he is on his way out And then you have the kindergarten manager in Nauzdal
She
has now been replaced, probably in NAV
She does not work as a manager anymore And that would never have happened if we had not traveled And said, listen, now it is enough
Then we use different methods
to get them out
But the point is to get them out Such people can not have in... We have to use this for everything
Because then we point out the crime And then the municipality must react And then afterwards we have to tell that
Then we can use that too
I feel that they just turn around
For example, I was just down there
Go to a single kindergarten manager It does not look like that
It's complete corruption And does not get any consequences
Had others done that?
Had you been the boss of a large international company And behaved like that
Then you would not have just been moved away And you would have been kicked out And been sued and the whole package But there is hope
, I think But now we talked a little about it Intern And some have fronted a little publicly International crime card, as you see
So when it started to go
public
Then people said no, stop Because if you do that in a specific case
Then you will lose your child's water proof Because that's what they have
experienced But in Sweden
Then the social service thought
That a group had
gone to
the search
Then there were employees in the Swedish kindergarten Who moved from the country Because that's the only hope we have Because they can report And in the whole process Not research and punish And they are, but Norway is a member of it And there are stories so well in there now But they need a lot of stories But they already see in Norway And they also go into the EMD And get information from there You see now that several organizations in the EU
Now investigate
Norway Then we have nine
, maybe ten cases in the EMD Yes, I heard that last time There are probably more that pop up So we just have to keep the pressure But tomorrow, what exactly is down there in Kristiansand?
Will there be a meeting?
Then I just have to say it This community, I asked a little
I asked if
I could call the councilor And the warden if you do not do anything But we have a little confidence in this
Publicly
So
you get to drive And we never give up, so it's like that And we have many More
than you
There are surprises that are not said here and now But more
will come
It will be like that Make you uncomfortable for people
And the population And that
no one can be a member of this community
Then you rise up against communism
And it's the same
attitude we see That totalitarianism
Then they can just call us children's hatred as we want It's those who hate the children We love our children when we can set them free
They turn everything
upside down
Now we have seen that most of
us who call us children's wardens Had lost their jobs after a while So keep up the good work We get proof that we are dealing with reality Yes The truth will come out I'm not screwed up When you see injustice, lies and corruption And turn away from it, it does not work No No, but let's summarize
Tomorrow it will be Saturday the 15th Is it the 14th?
Yes Saturday the 15th 15th of
July there is an action in Kristiansand
They have
taken some pictures And we are going to film it We are on it Shall we apply here before the knot eats us up?
Yes Okay, then we say thank you to us here in Kristiansand And we never give up That's
true

Let the children be set free
I would like to welcome you to a new episode of the
Family Channel Today we have with
us someone who has experienced a lot in the childhood
I can start, my name is Rune Fardal
I have with me Anita and Stian He has probably been through most of it 25 times or in different places he has been placed In the time he has been in the care of the children
So Stian, how did this start?
Well, I came here when
I was around 9 years old when my mother died
Then they were to get support
at home and help to get over it Which apparently was supposed to be very nice
I can not remember so much of it, I started to get support
I would not say that it was very
positive support But it was something to be with
It did not work so well and
I was really looking forward to the support
If you were brave, you got more of your will, then you got where you wanted
Then I got a stemo when
I was around 10 years old
Then
I started to get a little violent My father started to beat me with his flat hand After a couple of years
I left for the first time
I was 12-13 years old when
I left for the car
I went to the police and came to a child care Then my father had told the police that they had beaten me And that I had to leave the school when
I was at the children's center
Then I got the message that everything was going
to be fine
Then after six days
I got the message that
I was leaving tomorrow
Then
I remembered that the world was very different from me
After that
I was very sad when
I was home and not at school Then
I thought that
I had to leave the school by myself
I had to jump from the third floor
It was not something
I wanted to do, but it was just for the children's center
So
I could leave the school
After you got help?
Yes, because
I felt that
I wanted to be better Then we moved to an institution in Paradise It is in Bergen, Akutte deli When
I got there, there were two women at work and three men Two girls lived there One was a little mentally ill The other was 17 years old and had suffered a lot with the virus
I was 13 years old then, it was the summer of 2013 When
I got there, the adults were very
upset that
I was not going to be with the other young people
So
I tried very hard to stay away from them Was it because they were in Norway with the virus and you were not?
Yes, and
I was not going to be
there for long
It worked for some time, but it was after some time that
I wanted to be with them
I got sick, and
I did not
want to be alone, I wanted friends
I was in a completely new place, so
I started to be with them and
I started to get angry
I left at once because
I did not feel that it was a good place to be
I did not feel that the adults knew me, because they worked 8 hours
a day and then they were home
So
I did not get
a proper relationship with them I stayed at the home of the couple, in Knarvik, in Lindås It was very good there
There lived an elderly woman and an elderly man, and they lived there for 18 months
They did not disturb me, they had a very good time, went
to school They had strict rules around me and performed relatively well at school They were going to move me to the foster home
It was a process that took almost a
year for them
It was about
five different foster homes The first was the one that my whole family wanted me to have
There
were kind people who did dog training and such
They would treat me well, they would take care of the family But this was not good enough, and the same
thing happened with three other families Did they give you any reasons why it was not good enough?
I did not get any reason, I got a message that we found something that was possible But they did not want it anyway, so
I just said no
, I am not going there
So
I kept waiting for them to move, and then
I got a message that
I was going to move to a man
I lived in Manger, and it was near where
I lived, so
I could continue to go to the same school
At this time, the foster home started to worry about me having difficulty in tilting
I had met him three times before
I moved to the foster home
I had opened the foster home once
It did not go so well, because he did not have time for me
He had a job that he was about to lose
He had bought a farm and such, so
I did not feel that anyone had time for me
The school started to get worse, it was longer to travel
So
I decided to move, because it felt like a good thing to do After a while
I tried to talk to the foster home and tell them that I could not live there
I did not feel that it was a good place to live, so
I did not take it seriously
I tried for four months to talk to them and try
to move from there
It did not work out, so
I moved here in the winter
I walked the street in Bergen for three days, I was about 14 and a half years old
I remember that it was snowing outside,
I slept with the choir in a shelter I was very heavy on the narcomal, because it was the only place you could walk that actually listened to what you had to say I did not feel that
I got the help
I needed I was called by the police and placed on a clock tower It was not a good way, because
I just got a message that
I had to dress up And that
I had to do a body check, and that
I did not have anything dangerous or bad on me
I got a message that
I had to go to the toilet, and that I had to sleep in an isolated cell You had a bathroom with your own door, and a bed that was stuck in the wall You had a person who came to feed you, and you had to knock on the door So it was a prison cell?
Yes, it was very much like being in a flat cell, just that you had a toilet
I was there for 24 hours, before
I was placed in the cell Were you locked in?
Were the doors locked?
Yes, the doors were locked 24 hours
And then
I was placed in the cell It was a white room with a sofa and a TV that was stuck, and you could not lift it The chair weighed a lot, and it was heavy to pull out the dinner chair We only had plastic bodies and such We had two adults with us, and we were not allowed to wear shoes, we had to wear socks or sandals The whole area was locked in with a low door, but it was high enough that you had to struggle to get out You could not just run And then a gate that stood up We had our own school in the area I
lived there for a month, and you did not get any time alone, you went to the shower and it took 5 minutes before someone knocked on the door and heard that everything was fine Sorry, that was a bit late It's ok
Every 5 minutes someone would knock on the door and hear that everything was fine And if you were more than half an hour
, they had to see you
So you could not take a long shower to get out In the evening we had night watchmen who would come and watch us every hour When
I got out of there, I went to the Kalvfære, where Bergen had a cut service What did you learn?
Did you get any help or anything?
Or was it just a survival out there?
I do not really know why
I was moved to the first home, and why they chose to place me in a locked institution But where is the clock tower?
Where is it located?
It is located on the old Øfstund center So it was just pure survival?
Yes, it was pure survival
No therapy or anything?
It was just a place to be placed and locked in so that they could have a place to stay Because what you describe with this room and this bath, is exactly the same as the one they have at Sandvikens sykehus Yes It is exactly the same, that is where
I have been
It is so sick like a prison cell Yes, at Sandvikens they have a window in the door so they can look in And then they knock on the door and check people all the time So it is open to them And they can sleep in there for an hour Yes After that you came to a first home?
No, I came to Kalfa I was going to live in a small apartment there, with a adult who was going to take care of me Because they thought that the other kids who lived there, would not have a good influence on me because of what they had seen before And then there lived four girls between the age of 15 and 17 and two boys of the same age Five of them were very strong with drugs and one was a bit difficult to be with And it went very well and one of the girls up there was a bit difficult
So they thought that the other kids needed the apartment and the other kids had to be taken care of So
I sat there like a 14 year old with four girls and one boy between the age of 17 and 15 who
loved to play
So this was around
May, and
I was very happy to go out and do things like that
I remember that there were things that
were too much for my room and they always
tried to get me out And in the end
I started to be a part of it And it was the fourth night
I had been a part of it for three weeks And when
I got home, the staff just smiled a lot and didn't say anything
They were very steady, they asked me where
I was going to go after this, where
I was going to stop And then they just smiled and said, don't worry, I will be fine And then
I woke up and two policemen came into my room and said that you were going to Klockalia
Then
I had been out for two months And then
I was back at Klockalia, same procedure, the policemen saw that
I was wearing clothes So
I went back up and checked that
I didn't have any extra clothes And I took a shower and stayed
there for another 24 hours
And then
I was at another department in Klockalia And now that
I was there, I didn't
want to be there
, I lived with a friend of mine So
I started to leave And when
I had been there for three weeks
, I had been there four times Did you get any help during that time?
Or was it just one stay?
It was just one stay, at least that's how
I felt That time
I wasn't allowed to go to school either, so
I didn't have anything to do during the days And after three weeks, when
I came back and had been there for two days
I was sitting on the couch, and suddenly a police officer came
He jumped over the table, grabbed the roof of my head, hit me on the couch And yelled at me that
I had just been out for a week and that
I was going to be arrested
I was sitting there, scared with three police officers and three young people And I was wondering what was going on and what
I had done And afterwards the adults asked me what the fuck had happened And they were like, no, I haven't done anything wrong
I just didn't understand anything
The other young people had said that they had been there, and
I asked about the police
I didn't get a response
I told my lawyer, but
I wasn't arrested again And after that
I realized that it would be
best to send me to Østfold Because
I just had a negative environment in Bergen And then
I was going to be placed in a way that
I would get help to improve my experience And then help me to leave the people
there
So then
I was told that
I was going to an institution that had their own car, horse, and a farm Until today, did you feel that all these places got some of the help they suddenly saw that they needed?
No, it was just living somewhere and not being a burden in a way Yes, I lived somewhere and you didn't want to be home because you were a burden You got a roof and food, and you didn't have any therapy, talking groups, or conversations No, it never came to any of these places When
I was sent to Østfold, it was the first youth that was newly enrolled in
an institution And when
I was sitting in the car with the staff, I asked them how they were doing, how many people
lived there, and so on And I was told that
I was the first youth
There is another youth coming in two days And that there has been
a company that was doing something about the institution
They had none of these things in their brochure, and
I had a paperbunker And they were doing a lot of activities, but nothing was happening My father had heard that they had contact with Danish scientists who specialized in people with human problems So he was interested in knowing that it worked When I arrived, they had none of these things, and they didn't have internet
Two days later, an 18 year old moved in with me
He had severe smoking problems Three weeks passed, and another one from Trondheim came in with severe smoking problems And they asked the adults what kind of institution this was, and I had completed 15 And they said that this was a smoking institution And in my papers it didn't say that
I needed help smoking, so
I just had to help because
I was a little bit tired of meeting people But that couldn't help me with that institution because it was a smoking institution
So I was in the wrong place The approach wasn't what you thought it would be?
Yes, and it was written on the papers And there was a lot of smoking when
I lived there Was it beer, or
narcotic substances?
I was addicted to narcotic substances, mainly cannabis, and sometimes pills at that time
I had my
first overdose when
I lived there for two months And the staff who came with me didn't know that
I had overdosed
It took two days before
I came home, and luckily
I was trained to work there And I noticed that my breath was too calm, and
I almost didn't have a pulse
So it could have gone very badly, because the staff didn't know about these things And that was a smoking institution, with people who didn't know about the overdose Yes That's good
I lived there for two years, and
I didn't get to travel to meet people
I didn't go to school with
I didn't go to school for eight months, and
I had no activities, and
I was mostly at home When
I first started going to school, I went to a special school where three students went And it wasn't a good place to go, I didn't feel like
I learned anything
So
I started working, and it went very well But when they felt that
I had done something wrong, they punished me for not letting me go to work
So if I had...
So what you felt was good for you, they took it away from you?
Yes, if I went out drinking with friends, I would say, no, you can't go to work on Wednesdays, because you've been out partying And at that institution, it was normal for people to
smoke every day And they didn't get the same consequences as me
They smoked at the institution?
At a smoking institution?
Yes, I did that too We smoked in the bathroom, we sat in the living room and smoked cannabis
Doesn't cannabis smell like you can smell it?
Cannabis smells very strong, according to the police
So those who work here, they must have felt it
They must have
felt
it, if they work and have their
They must have known how the substances look like, how they smell
, everything
They must have
known Yes, I remember that, we sat with the staff sometimes With the narcotics staff?
Yes Smell the staff together
Smoking
at the institution, smoking with the staff, that's when you wonder where the help was Yes, but really, the smell of the staff, cannabis together with you I had one staff member who sat next to me when we smoked, I remember that That was when
I moved to my
own apartment, still in Østborg
At that time
I was moved around a lot, because they thought it was difficult to have me in the apartment Because a girl who worked with me had moved in When we were together for two months, I was moved to a charity shelter in Trusil
I lived there for three months, I was told that
I was not allowed to be at the charity for more than one month Why did you move?
They felt that it was not positive that two people living together had a sexual relationship So when you finally could make contact with people, you moved to a shelter in Trusil?
Yes That's really good, but it's really good that you tell us, just continue
I woke up the next morning and got the message that we were going on a drive, to Trusil and then to Snorborg We got up there and went into the cabin, and said that we were going to stay here until the adults felt safe that you were coming home
Then Hans had bought me up,
I realized that
I had a very good contact with a very good man in the kindergarten He got a phone number, and said that there were two people on their way to watch over us, and that when they got up you could go home
He read the phone and said that it was not important, that we didn't need two people, we needed one person who he could talk to If not, it would just be a fight up here Then it was just two of the first employees that
I had a good contact with, who were with me up here They had
a regular shift for three days, so
I felt that they were people who had actually sacrificed something to give something back to me
They wanted to be nice and take care of what they did After that
I was moved back to the apartment, where I stayed for two weeks
Then I was moved to another apartment in Kroksund, which was 20 minutes from
where
I lived Yes, 23 minutes They called it a side apartment of the house But according to their laws, the side apartment is too far away in the air distance, and you have to be under the age of 20 to get
there
So it was not allowed to use the apartment, so it became a side apartment
I lived there for a year and a half
How big was the
apartment?
We lived on 60 square meters Was it with all the facilities?
Yes, it was two bedrooms, one bed, and the kitchen was the same
Very thin walls, so you heard everything the neighbors did And you lived there for two?
Six months Was it in the winter or summer?
I moved in a little before winter and moved out a little before summer
After
I lived there for a while, I got an apartment in Mysen, 85 square meters
The first thing that came to my mind was that the landlord wanted 5000 more because he wanted to rent it out to the children
People wanted
to make money When I was down there, I noticed that the employees started calling the police Because they wanted to rent out the apartment
I don't know why, because they never found anything illegal there
I remember the police came and threatened me once Without any papers, they just stood in my way when
I was alone It was around my apartment in my country How old were you?
I was 16 years old When
I started working, I just came home from work What did you do?
I worked in a security guard company
, so
I started up A security guard service, on houses and buildings?
Yes, we have built a garden, a garden, a house, a garden, a grave Was it in Mysen?
No, it was in the whole of the east And we had a couple of employees in Sweden
I got a lot of letters from them But the employees were very...
They were like, we are going to do it wherever you want If any of the instructions were to be checked, I always got letters And then...
I was in the operating room for a week, because I was at least a bit more mature And then
I went to Fredrik's place to visit his friend And they had bought me a pack of cannabis And the adult tells me that there is a car behind us with two people
So if you have
anything with you, you have to throw it out of the window when we get there And
I say, maybe you should take it with you And Fredrik says, no, but throw it in the car, so he won't see you throwing it And he throws it in the car, and then he says that he has gone in and the adult says to me That you should go out and get it, he says, yes And then it was easy to get it back
He had worked at the institution for five or six years and had time to learn how to drive And then it was back down there, in my apartment And then
I got a new message And
I don't know, but I got a message that if you don't behave, you will be sent to Northern Norway And then they had just sent another youth who lived at the institution to Northern Norway
So
I didn't know why they had done it, so
I was scared of it And I didn't want to
go to Northern Norway, I heard about the big mosquitos and that it was cold
I can write about that on the big mosquito And many, I was a milder So I asked my employer if I could move to the Mollikollektiva or Styvigård And they knew that
I had a friend in both places And I was a bit skeptical about it, but after three months And I had been
sent to Bergen, to a dance group meeting And the last staff member had told me before
I went out the door Have you remembered your PSN and clothes?
We were not supposed to sleep over in Bergen But it was nice that
I had my PSN and extra clothes, preferably two days When
I get there with the staff and the department manager, I will have an hour for myself And they call me after half an hour and say that we are at the airport Will you come to the airport or will you stay in the car?
No, I will stay in the city if I am called, that is correct
So
I stayed there for three months, no three weeks And then
I started to get scared and thought that it was time to go back And then
I was on a 412 paragraph, so when you have been
there for three weeks You lose your place and you have to find a new department
I can not get into this with a clear mind, because it was important to me when
I was in Rome And it was very important for me to be in Rome during these weeks Because then they had to say where
I was going, because
I did not
want to be in Russia But what
I experienced and saw in you, was that you were actually quite far down You were confused, you could not
answer why you were placed in the US And you were just like, I do not know,
I just have to keep myself out of it So they have to move me And then you just have to say, yes, ok But after those three weeks you were moved to Molle, was it?
No, when
I went to report myself
at the police station I was told that my name is Stian Stolsen and I have been on the run for three weeks From this and that station in Østfold and was reported missing in Bergen And the police man looks around for me and does not manage to find me
I had not been reported missing in Bergen, I had only been reported missing in Østfold And
I thought that was very strange, since
I had been
reported missing while
I was in Bergen After that
I was placed at the police station in the end of the day And then it was the same procedure, I had to take a shower
I was there for about 16 hours
I think, and then
I was taken to the airport And then
I was allowed to fly to Østfold by myself
To Rygge?
No, to Gardermoen And then I met the staff there and was driven to
Ørnevegen outside
Rygge But there was no flight
to Rygge at that time
, I think
I lived there for one month and was placed at Tåpe Which is one of the departments to Måløy Which is a kind of
I was also there, so
I was driven there When we first arrived, they took us to Rygge and then we were all packed And then we were all packed, I was in the shower and then we met the other youths The first thing
I knew was that we could not be banned here If you are going to Rygge, you have to go out, we do not talk about drugs, we do not talk about common acquaintances, we do not talk about the past They were very strict about it, but if you did this, you could be sent on a trip And then you had to talk about why you did it and what you got out of it, so that was the consequence of what they did And that usually took three or four days
So we came up there to say hello to the other youths, there were two from
Bergen and one from
Østfold And it was very nice, we lived together for three weeks And then we got the message that we were going to March And none of us had anything to do with that, so we went up the mountain
It was up in the Ustdalaltsbreda mountain
, up on the mountain seat there And we drove up there and had our own bus up a path that was not far up in the mountain And there we were three weeks to learn how to make beijer, which was there And we learned about the mountain seat for three weeks, and went on trips and talked about our history And we started to get help for our problems And we noticed that it was very difficult, and now there was actually someone who cared about it, and this was very
strange
Because there
were people around constantly, and then
I had actually seen these people for a long time And
they had shown that they had been at work for two weeks, and they were back home in two weeks And they had a very nice tone about it And then we went out for a week and slept in a tent up on the mountain Before we got the message that now you are ready to come down to the house And this was because we had to be ready and we had to know how to behave with each other Because there were other young people down at the house who had been there for three months, two years, and so on Who really wanted to be Russian, and had worked hard for it And we got a very nice welcome, where
they had made a four-bedroom dinner for us, nicely covered And everyone stood outside welcoming us And then they had this ghost about the sea, that if you go out you will always get a warning
Just two meters down to the sea And then
I finally got to help the problems and start talking about thoughts and everything that had happened
I remember that was the only place that was really good, if not the best place
to be
at home
Where
you felt safe, and
there was no one to talk to about it
It was also because you felt that there
were people who cared about you
So you gave
a little extra support or something to get you going You got feedback that said, this is going well, maybe you will want to be there more And we had a work day, we always had to get up at first So we had to be up until 8 am on TV, and then we would watch TV and eat breakfast
So if you
didn't do that you had to
be sick
all day And then you had to plan
every day, preferably for a whole week on a regular day And if you didn't do that you had to do something the next day And that was actually a lot of things that
I did myself And I
remember we had a phase system depending on what you had worked with And that made it a lot more difficult to know that this person was struggling with that
So maybe you shouldn't mention that person
So we had
a little respect for the planer, just knowing that this person is in phase 3 Or that person is in phase 1 And we knew that we needed help And you had
to take care of certain situations And you felt that the adults helped the youth And we built it as a family And we had a lot of tasks every day
So we had to do that, and we had to clean a lot of houses Because we have 16 people who live together And then we had to do that and that and clean up So you learned to have structure on your day to day life Even though it was a little bit of a burden
So maybe you thought about that?
Yes, we got a very strong structure that everyone of us needed But it was in a very kind way that they did it And
I remember the first Christmas
I celebrated up there was the best Christmas
I can remember to this day And that is why
I moved to Gathegade for two years And
then
I moved back to Bergen That was the real reason That's how it was How is it to be met by a child care worker when you come out of an institution?
Because it is a place, at least here in Molløy, with some good homes And then to be dumped by a child care worker Yes, when
I moved from Molløy
I was going to Bergen And then
I was going to a shelter with an apartment And continued to get treatment while
I lived in Bergen and went to school And then
I had to go to the RIM test twice a week To prove that it was still a mess And that things were going well and that
I could not prove that there was alcohol on the way to the RIM test And
I felt that it was a lot of stress for me
I was in Bergen and unfortunately
I started to get drunk again And then you lived alone on Hybel?
Then I lived in a campsite in Bergen with a child care worker from
Molløy Who was going to help me find an apartment
So it was probably up to all that stress that
I lived in a bad place back in Bergen And then
I had some internal problems with my family
So
I started to smoke again, cannabis And then my child care worker did not want this offer anymore
So then it was over on NAV and I was placed in a small Hybel With a lot of strong drugs around that
Hybel And far out in Ingemasland where it goes five weeks a day
So then it became very difficult to get out there
Then it became a preservation again?
Yes, then it was too far to travel and be able to complete school and so on So in the end
I had to stop school because
I could not stay at six o'clock every day to get to school
It's not very planned what they do
It seems like they are coming in again, where should we put him?
A campsite, okay, fine wine and apartment, there maybe
So it's a very strange way to treat people Who maybe needed a little more structure Got some help, some positive feedback, as you might have experienced in Molløy It's very strange that they are at an institution and there is no plan for anything You should leave the institution and live in a campsite in Månsfå and look for an apartment
Where is the plan?
From there there is no plan in anything
They could have found an apartment and then you could move out Instead they say, no you should stop, okay, where should we do it?
In a campsite, okay, and then we have to look for an apartment
It's tragic when you see it from a distance
It should not
be like that, it's not strange
It goes badly afterwards, if there is no afterwards, because there is no world It's just a problem for them, they have to find another place Imagine if you had to
go to the hospital, you could sit here for a couple of days And find a room for yourself, it would have been
a crisis at once You are not treated as a person, you are treated
as a number on a note Where should we get that?
It's a problem for them It's a number on a note, quite simply What
I also think about this is that you were first in contact with the children when you were 9 years old And then you were placed when you were 12 years old From 12 until you were 16 years
old
It was after the summer when you were 16 that you were placed on the list Yes, I was at the full 17 Yes, you were at the full 17 Yes, I was there for quite a few years without any help As you feel, the first place that you got the idea was
at Måløy They took it seriously, they had
a plan, but all the others were just thinking about where to put you
It seems like that
And when you were in the Mysen, you met a girl who you fell in love with And how do they solve it?
They tear you apart, they send you to Trisil That's exactly what you shouldn't do when someone finds meaning in life Why don't you build that out?
Why don't you get your own apartment?
You can have structure there, but you build relationships But they do the opposite, they send people to Trisil It's quite far up in the hills, in the middle of nowhere That's it, and that relationship lasted for quite a long time, because we were promised at some point So we could actually live together
Not only that, but how many times do you get the chance to be in this?
All the places are filled with emotions, it's chaos, it's unstructured There must have been a lot of different schools you went to, right?
It was a youth school, right?
Yes
, at the end of the primary school and the middle school If you were 9, you were at the primary school Yes, but you weren't moved to the primary school, you were in 7th grade
I was supposed to go to the primary school, but
I was...
I only went to the youth school because of the primary school
I was only allowed to
go to the 4th grade So during the primary school
I only went to 4 schools 4 schools?
But there must have been some kind of break-up, you can't go to one school and the next the next day
Even though you were moved, you lost some time in between?
Yes, I wasn't at school the entire time
Last half of the year
I was in 9th grade, and the entire 10th grade The municipality has a responsibility for you getting education Yes, they are legally responsible for the requirements for education
Actually There are a lot of holes in the pencil, and when you get into a school where the pencils are overdubbed
Then you have a hole in the pencil that makes it difficult to get into school
It gets worse every year, because you miss some of the things that others have gotten, and then you suddenly get there
I would have felt
a bit confused at least Yes, that was the reason
I moved, I moved Yes, ok, we met twice in the city, and
I wanted him to contact a lawyer Because I didn't think he would be alone when he was married And he was quite doubtful and confused It was very confusing, and it was very painful to see a child like that Yes, of course, when you don't have a base in life, you are here and there And where you are, there is no one who really cares You are actually in the way, in a way, a bit in the past, there is a problem, what do we do with him?
Move a camping car to find something else
I think if you had done that with someone else, a child,
then the system would have reacted
If you were to go into the health center and say, no we don't have any room for you in
Sandvikken
So you can live in a camping car, there is a room
That would
have been the first suggestion
I had, but when you are a child, you put a lid on it
I don't think people really know how bad it is out there
No, it's a child lock, it's a house lock, no one is allowed in, no one knows what's going on It's a house lock, there are sensitive lights, people who don't want to know But it seems like the reason they shouldn't know is not because your story should come up, but because your faith should be hidden
That's where they use the house lock, and it wasn't that house lock that
I thought of, I think
It was to protect the client or the person
Not to protect yourself, not because of how they are, and how they are actually met, and in that
way
It was a bit more about the relationship in the historian's time, so the purpose was to make sure that they could be released from their homes The point was that they had a problem at home, and they moved to somewhere that would solve that problem But the way you describe it, I don't feel like you got a solution to a problem You got new problems, and more difficult ones
I only got more problems and more stress That's where you see that you had a hard relationship with your father, or there was violence, and maybe that has something to do with your mother's death
That has something to do with it, and you need a new anchor point, and maybe your stepmother and father aren't
optimal And then you send yourself on a tour of 25 institutions and places, where you lost school, break up relationships with people you
are in contact with In the middle you find something that is good, but a lot of it isn't good And then you have to ask yourself, where was it worst?
Living with a stepmother or father, or 25 tours in the south of Norway That's when you start to see the relationship between these things They were weak and ungrateful in the child services, and that was the Os, the Os children's services That's
why
I ask a lot of questions about the qualifications of people who are in these places
They don't know exactly what they are doing, obviously No, a lot of them wouldn't have had that job I'm very glad that
I had the right business counselor when
I went to Måløy, then
I would have gotten
a new one as a good business counselor And you were there for about two years?
Yes, about two years
Do you have any memories of today?
I had memories of talking to one from
Måløy once a week, and the other once a week The children
didn't feel that it was doing
anything, so they left What did you feel?
That it was ok?
For me it's fine that
I left, because
I know that the staff will meet me
as often as
I need to, and that they will still be there
So it's fine for me when
I left And now you live in an apartment?
Right now I live with some friends,
I can't be alone, I don't want to have so many people around me
So it's like you control your needs, you need to find
an environment where you can have a relationship Because as you say, it can be difficult to live alone, and suddenly find out about life,
but when you've been in a structured setting like Måløy, you know that there's no one who will watch out for you When you've gone through 9 to 18, the brain has developed in a way that you've experienced the world And it has probably been the same for the last two years, and it's not easy to sit alone and say that life is going to be a mess
So
I guess you need someone to have a relationship with, to
go out with friends That's true
If I notice that there's a problem, a challenge, I just sit alone and think about what to do And
then
I have someone to talk to, because I've always had
friends Have you gotten someone you can call if you need someone to talk to?
No So you're really all alone now Yes, and I've heard that the therapist can call me once in six months That's what they can do now That's just silly I've been here for 12 years, and I'm alive, so I can see you for another 12 years Do you live on the street?
Yes, I live in Kimoloka, we moved from
Tåspit My husband pays rent, so it's not easy to get a house, at least not on this place, so you're lucky But I've noticed that when
many young people come out of the child care, there's a lot of chaos
There's poor control over the economy, there's no money,
there's social unrest If you had to set up something, what would you rather have had from the child care, have you gotten help?
No, as I see it, I don't feel like I could continue to help with the housing I've gotten a place that's cozy, where I can feel at home But now you're forced to leave the house, and they cover the rent?
Yes, they cover the rent and social support
Have they given you any signals, or do you need to go to work or school?
I've been out of work, and unfortunately I didn't manage to get a job,
I tried to go to school in Binnasmål, and
I was forced to leave
From Bergen to where?
From Osute on Askvik, to Sandslid That's
a long way, at least Bus stops?
Yes, I had to take the bus at
6 in the morning That's too much
So you didn't have any school bags, or a flat here?
No, I wasn't allowed to go to Navbergen, I had to go to Navos, and they couldn't give me anything near the centre Because they had nothing, and they couldn't send me to Navbergen, because I had to settle in the municipality
So it would have been
a bit unnatural to have to go all the way to the centre after school?
Yes, they would have to rent a flat, and they paid the same amount So you would have paid, not just for a flat, but also for a school, and had a better chance of going to school And through that you got further, but now you're in Hagervik, and you're sitting there?
That's not a very good way to say it, it's a storage, it's nice in Hagervik, but you might need something else You need something else, it's a nice view You said you had a better trip in Bergen, where you have friends, but it's more of a place to find someone?
Yes, it's a bigger place, and you know people from all over Norway who can move anywhere, and then you have a place to stay
So if you live far out in the woods, and you don't have the opportunity to meet your friends, then you don't really have friends You don't get to develop any relationships with people, and it's hard for them to get far out there, and meet you there It's not the best bus out there No, it's 5-6 buses a day, and the last one was at 9.30
That's a lot of work, it's like a new home in a house Yes, it is
I think we've had a good story, we've heard what you've experienced, and
I think we've managed to keep going for the next hour
Time goes by quickly, so we can round off here
I hope everyone out there has gotten
a little insight into how the childcare system is in this case at Os People are taken away from children who need help, people are moved around 25 times, social relations are broken, they are placed far away from school and social
life
That's not the answer to the question of which outcome
Thank you Anita, and thank you Stian, you're
a good storyteller Thank you for coming We'll say thank you for this time, and we'll be back with similar
stories that we're working on Thank you for listening
